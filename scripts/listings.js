Work or replacement items cannot begin until we have required photographs.\r\n\r\nOAK BARREL INFO:\r\n\r\nThere are lots of oak barrel makers out there (with lots of different theories and practices) and there is lots of info on the Web. We suggest learning more if you have specific questions. Here are some helpful tips we found online (this is just a general summary of information and not meant to be complete):\r\n\r\n• As the barrels are a wood product, they are subject to the wood drying and shrinking.\r\n• In order for the spigot to flow freely, please remember to remove the bung/cork before you open the spigot ... pour from the spigot ... then close the spigot and finally ... replace the bung/cork. \r\n• To keep your barrels performing and looking their best, please keep them stored in a protected area away from the elements and optimally in a cool and relatively humid area. \r\n• Barrels with painted black steel hoops are particularly susceptible to moisture. A little care goes a long way. Prevent excessive staining and rust by keeping the exterior of the barrel dry.\r\n• Avoid water stains by using a funnel to carefully fill your new barrel. \r\n• Sandpaper will generally remove any stains or marks on the barrel. \r\n• As the barrels are handcrafted, liquid volume is approximate. \r\n• You should be able to reuse your barrel from 3-5 times ... remember that each aging will take longer than the previous one. \r\n• Please do not nail or put screws into the hoops or staves as doing so will compromise the oak and might cause damage. \r\n• If you want to age a different type of spirit then was initially aged in it, we recommend you use a new barrel. \r\n• For your safety, if using chemicals to clean/sanitize your barrels, please follow the manufacturer’s instructions for proper use.\r\n• The spirit can age anywhere from one week to one-year, but it&#39;s recommended that you take a small taste test every two weeks.  Remember to only take a small taste to ensure the top of the barrel does not get dry to avoid leaking and losing your spirit to the &#39;Angel&#39;s Share.&#39;  Once the spirit reaches your perfect taste, empty the spirit into a decanter and restart the process!\r\n\r\nAngel’s Share.\r\nAngel’s Share is a fancy name for evaporation. Since mini-barrel staves are thinner than normal distillery size 53-gallon barrel staves, there is a higher “angel’s share”, thus higher evaporation. To avoid this evaporation, make sure you follow the instructions and 1) fill the barrel to the very top when first filling the barrel with your spirit; and 2) keep the top of the barrel moist after using the barrel by rolling the liquid around every couple of days. As previously mentioned, we recommend taking very small taste-tests every two weeks to ensure much of the top of the barrel does not become dry.&quot;\r\n\r\nStoring your Empty Barrel After Initial Use \r\nIdeally, your barrel would always be filled. Used barrels require no special preparation beyond a simple water rinse, if desired, when transferring out and in immediately. If used barrels are to be stored empty, rinse them several times with clean water, and drain thoroughly. Remove the spigot and bung to promote air flow and store out of sunlight and in a cool (55° – 60°) and optimally humid (65% - 75%) area. \r\n\r\nAn alternative is to fill and store barrels with a sulfur-citric holding solution (recipes are online). This holding solution promotes sanitation and keeps the barrels swelled and smelling sweet however ... it will strip some of the oaks flavors. For your safety and the safety of your family, always follow manufacturers’ guidelines and instructions for the proper use of chemicals. \r\n\r\n",

"policy_welcome": "Hello and welcome to our shop! My name is Amy, and my husband, Tyler and I are the owners and creators of Liquid Courage. We have been selling online since 2003. Recently, we decided to make the leap from selling items made by others to selling items that we make. We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. \r\n\r\nTyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well.  Upon graduating, we tried &quot;real, grown-up jobs&quot; - Tyler as a general manager at a greenhouse manufacturing company, and I as a staff accountant for a nationwide manufacturing company.  We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach. We chose the path less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\r\n\r\nPlease don&#39;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or would like a custom item.\r\n\r\n(888) 959-2870 (M-F 9am - 5pm Eastern)\r\nor\r\nConvo us anytime! \r\n\r\nCheers! \r\nTyler and Amy",

"title": "The Dylan Tee - Unisex - PRE ORDER",
"description": "This baby is part of our Music Muse series, inspired by musicians and bands who fill our hearts and lives with tunes that move us.  This series will constantly be growing as time goes on...\n\n\nABOUT THE SHIRT:\nPrinted on super soft heathered tees, they are perfect for lounging around the house all day, or outfitting with your favorite flannel and skirt for a day out.  In our minds, a good tee is the perfect base for any outfit.\n\nThe fit of these runs about a size small in the women&#39;s style, so size up if you don&#39;t want it to fit you too tight.  If your unsure, grab your favorite fitting tee and compare the measurements with the size chart below.  Weve included both the women&#39;s and unisex for size comparisons.  The biggest difference in style between these is that the women&#39;s neckline scoops a bit lower and they are more fitted, where as the unisex ones are a bit longer, more boxy and have a higher neckline (and of course are more true to men&#39;s sizing).  But they both are made from super soft heathered material that just feels so good on!  All inks used are eco-friendly water based inks.\n\n**Size note: Model is wearing the women&#39;s size medium, and is 5&#39;2&quot; and 115 lbs.**\n**Material is: Tri-Blend (50% Polyester / 25% Ring-Spun Cotton / 25% Rayon) **\n**Color is heather tri-coffee (sort of a light brown)**\n\n\nSHIPPING DATES // PLEASE READ:\n\nMost of our shirts are PRE-ORDER only, meaning they are not ready to ship.  They take 6-7 weeks before they are shipped off to you, although we do strive to send them out quicker if we can.  You can always refer to your invoice to see when your estimated shipping date is.  Although we do try out best to get them out quicker we cannot guarantee it.  Please only order if you are okay with this wait.\n\n**A little extra info explaining the pre-order time length: Skyline Fever is currently our second job.  James works a full-time day job, while Laura runs her own full-time business.  We hope that one day we can call Skyline Fever James full time job, so every pre-order gets us one step closer to being able to provide quicker turn around times!  Until then, we will do our best to get out each order as quickly as possible while creating them during our evenings and weekends.  We really can&#39;t thank everyone enough for always being so patient and loving our work enough to wait that long, it means the world to us!**\n\n\nSIZE CHART:\nWomen&#39;s Small //  Size 0-2 // Chest Width 16-7/8&quot; // Front Body Length 25-7/8&quot;\nWomen&#39;s Medium //  Size 4-6 // Chest Width 17-3/8&quot; // Front Body Length 26-1/2&quot;\nWomen&#39;s Large // Size 8-10 // Chest Width 17-7/8&quot; // Front Body Length 27-1/8&quot;\nWomen&#39;s XL // Size 12-14 // Chest Width 18-3/8&quot; // Front Body Length 27-3/4&quot;\n\nUnisex Extra Small // Chest Width 15-3/8&quot; // Front Body Length 27-3/4&quot;\nUnisex Small // Chest Width 17-3/8&quot; // Front Body Length 28-3/4&quot;\nUnisex Medium // Chest Width 19-3/8&quot; // Front Body Length 29-3/4&quot;\nUnisex Large // Chest Width 21-3/8&quot; // Front Body Length 30-3/4&quot;\nUnisex XL // Chest Width 23-3/8&quot; // Front Body Length 31-3/4&quot;\nUnisex 2XL // Chest Width 25-3/8&quot; // Front Body Length 32-3/4&quot;\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT: Please note that all of our designs are copyrighted and my not in any way be recreated.",

CHECK YOUR SPAM FOLDER \r\n\r\nNote: 95% of the time orders placed by Thursday are delivered by that following Friday. If this wasn&#39;t helpful, send us an email, as we are no longer doing after-sales support directly on Etsy. \r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION: MY ORDER ARRIVED BROKE, ENGRAVED WRONG, ETC. WHAT&#39;S NEXT?\r\n\r\nreply: you see, we always and without question replace broken, incorrectly engraved items, free of charge, so please don&#39;t worry. just email us, let us know exactly what needs to be replaced along with a few supporting images (if convenient). typically speaking, lead-time for replacements are the same as the original order. If this wasn&#39;t helpful, send us an email, as we are no longer doing after-sales support directly on Etsy. \r\n\r\nQUESTION: I FORGOT TO LEAVE PERSONALIZATION DETAILS \r\n\r\nreply: you see, just send those details to the email address above with order # in subject line. we do not ship blank, non-personalized items. If this wasn&#39;t helpful, send us an email, as we are no longer doing after-sales support directly on Etsy. \r\n\r\nQUESTION: I NEED TO CHANGE MY SHIPPING ADDRESS \r\n\r\nreply: you see, as long as the order hasn&#39;t shipped, we can change the shipping address. simply email the shipping address with order # in subject line. If this wasn&#39;t helpful, send us an email, as we are no longer doing after-sales support directly on Etsy. \r\n\r\nWe appreciate your business. \r\n\r\nTeals Prairie & Co.",

"policy_additional": "Owing to the sudden growth of our international business (thank you Etsy!), the brother in our team has opened a very, very little work shop in Hong Kong. This effort not only moves us closer to some of our suppliers, but also allows us to ship international orders to Australia, Singapore, Japan, etc. including much of Europe, South America... cheaper and faster. \r\n\r\n*Expedited orders will come from our Hong Kong shop. \r\n\r\nNorth American customers, mainly USA and Canada, will not be affected by this addition, for you good folks, it&#39;s business as usual: engraved and shipped from Houston, Texas. Yee Haw!\r\n\r\nThis concept looked good on paper, let&#39;s hope it pays off- wish us luck!\r\n\r\nLastly, for items with multiple colors, for example journals, since our suppliers cannot keep accurate stock levels, we may substitute your purchase with the same product in a different stocked color. \r\n  ",

Ice cubes water down your whiskey and leave a moist layer of condensation on your glass, whiskey stones have all the benefits of ice without the hassles.\r\n\r\nWhiskey Stones are made out of cubes of solid soapstone which is softer than granite and won’t scratch your glass. Soapstone retains its temperature much longer than ice, so it will cool your whiskey or liquor of your choice and provide a more sustained chill. Whiskey Stones are also non-porous, odorless and tasteless so they won’t alter your favorite drinks. Whiskey Stones can also be used to warm your drinks and work well with non-alcoholic beverages too.\r\n\r\nStill thinking and in need of more ideas?

We go through each week to see where, if any, shipping has been less and then we issue a shipping refund for the difference.  On the other hand if the shipping actually cost more than you paid, well that&#39;s our problem as we set the prices so we will take the hit.**\r\n\r\n**Shipping within the US**  We know you would like to receive your order as soon as possible, and therefore use Priority Mail for the vast majority of what we ship.  We may use First Class post for small, lighter items to make sure the postage cost is as low as possible for you.  We make no money on shipping and always try to price our shipping at the most economical and quickest route for customers.\r\n\r\n**Shipping to Canada**  To ship to Canada we use Priority Mail and First Class international mail.  Again, we price our shipping costs at the most economical we can after taking into account the shipping and packaging price.  \r\n\r\n**For Shipping everywhere else**  We welcome international orders, and ship First Class International.  We did our best to weigh items and price them for international shipping, which we know can be expensive.  However please note that none of our prices include any possible custom charges in your country of residence.  We hope you understand that though it is rare, any additional charges from your country of residence are the responsibility of the customer.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding shipping.",
"policy_refunds": "We hope you are fully satisfied with all items you receive, however as a business we understand there are occasions when items could arrive damaged (due to shipping).  Should any item arrive damaged or incorrect please contact us with a photo of the damage immediately so we can rectify the problem and send a replacement item asap.  Sadly, as our items are custom made we cannot resell any returns and therefore do not offer refunds on purchases.  Customer satisfaction is really important to us, we shop online all the time and get great Customer Service.  We want to go above and beyond for you so please let us know any dissatisfaction so we can rectify it ASAP.",
"policy_additional": "FAQs - \r\n\r\nDo you have any coupon codes for discounts?  \r\n\r\nYes we do, right now there is a 10% of everything Spring sale, simply use the coupon code SPRINGSALE10 at checkout. (Valid February 28th 2015 - May 31st 2015).\r\n\r\nThere is also a free shipping code for any orders over $150, the code to enter is SHIP2MEFORFREE.\r\n\r\n(Only 1 code can be applied per order). \r\n\r\nHow long will it take for my order to be dispatched?\r\n\r\nWe know you would like your order to arrive ASAP and we want to get it to you fast.  Currently our turn around time is about 7 days on listings of more than 1 item (some small items dispatch within 2 days), however we set the dates in the shop to show 1 to 2 weeks.  This is because some orders are more complex and require more work therefore they could take longer.  Especially during High Sales periods like Christmas and Wedding Season (May through end of October).  Please rest assured we will get them made and posted to you as quickly as possible, but if you have a specific date in mind, just let us know and we will do our best for you.  \r\n\r\nDo you accept Custom Orders?\r\n\r\nYes we do, we are all about custom orders so please don&#39;t hesitate to contact us and we will be really happy to work with you.\r\n\r\nI need multiple items, but can not find a listing for the exact amount, what should I do?\r\n\r\nPlease contact us and we will create a custom listing just for you.  We offer discounts for multiples so let us know how many you need and we will do our best to work within your budget.\r\n\r\nCan you provide a proof first?\r\n\r\nWe don&#39;t offer a proof first for most orders due to the time it takes and the delay it can cause to orders, therefore we try to offer many variations of items in the shop listings.  However if you would like a proof before purchase it is available upon request.\r\n\r\nWhat Fonts do you offer for the engraving?\r\n\r\nYou can see a picture of some font examples in the item listing pictures, but there are more available, just let us know which font you would like if you can&#39;t find it on the list and we will do our best to get it for you.\r\n\r\nWe have an Official US Marine Corps Hobbyist License #31499",

Almost as much work goes into perfecting a bourbon barrel as does perfecting the iconic American whiskey. Carefully selected American White Oak is slowly dried outdoors for nearly a year. After being exposed to the rain and sun, it is kiln dried, assembled, and then charred to release the naturally occurring flavors that will be imparted to the whiskey. Though the blanks reek of whiskey, the final products (sadly, from an authenticity perspective) have no odor, having been sealed with finish.\n\nI have a few other barrel wood options besides Jack Daniels®, including Jim Beam, Maker&#39;s Mark, and Buffalo Trace. For this ring, I would be willing to use the rare stock I have from The Macallan.  Please see this blog post to see what I mean:\n\nhttp://www.wedgewoodrings.com/blog/2014/4/27/barrel-staves-and-the-many-options-at-our-disposal\n\nJACK DANIEL&#39;S is a registered trademark and is not involved in or affiliated with the production or distribution of this product!\n\n\nThe outer portion of this ring is made of Cobalt - the most scratch resistant and shatterproof material I offer.  Like titanium it is hypoallergenic and biocompatible.  However, in many circumstances under which your Titanium ring might scratch, Cobalt will not.   It is an alloy that is identical to Platinum in color, but it is an order of magnitude stronger.  Cobalt offers nearly the scratch resistance of Tungsten Carbide, but unlike Tungsten, Cobalt will not shatter if dropped. \n\nThe ring pictured is a satin finish, but a polished finishes is also available. The ring is also a domed profile (vs. a flat profile), which can also be changed. Just add the details you like in the &quot;message to seller&quot; section at checkout. \n\nThis is the first Cobalt ring with a wood interior ever offered.\n\nI highly recommend going to a jewelry counter to determine your size, even if you already know your size. &quot;Do it yourself&quot; ring sizing methods (string, etc.) should absolutely not be trusted. Be sure to be measured using the width you plan to order.\n\n+++SEE SHOP ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THE SHOP PAGE FOR CURRENT SHIP DATE+++\n\nNOTE ON WIDTH:\n\nThe minimum width for this style is 5mm.  The maximum is 8mm.\n\nRecommended width is calculated in this way: Size 5 is 5mm wide. Width increases .5mm per size above that. So:\n\nSize 5- 5mm\nSize 6- 5.5mm\nSize 7- 6mm\nSize 8- 6.5mm\nSize 9- 7mm\nSize 10- 7.5mm\nSize 11+ - 8mm\n\n\n************************************ IMPORTANT INFO ****************************************\n\n****************************************************************************************************\n****PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BE 100% SURE OF YOUR SIZE BEFORE ORDERING *****\n****************************************************************************************************\n\nCobalt lined wood rings can be adjusted up or down about 1/4 size (by removing or adding finish to the interior). Every ring is made to the exact size provided. An error in sizing that exceeds the margin provided above will necessitate a completely new ring. REFUNDS AND EXCHANGES WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE. BE 100% SURE OF YOUR ACCURATE AND CORRECT SIZE BEFORE ORDERING.\n\nPlease click on the &quot;Policies&quot; link (under Shop Info) to see wood ring care instructions and FAQ.\n\nEach ring is given multiple coats of a hybrid epoxy finish, which is completely water-proof and soap proof. This protective coating is sanded up to 12,000 grit for an unbelievable, glass-like finish.\n\nAll rings ship via USPS Priority (or Priority International) Small Flat Rate Box. If you are outside the US and Canada, your shipping option is Global Express by default.  Please read below for details.  Insurance is mandatory for this ring, and included in the shipping charge. You pay what I pay for shipping, nothing more.\n\nFor customers outside the US:\n\nDue to changes in USPS policy, international packages sent to countries other than Canada can no longer be tracked past the US border.  Insurance claims are also not possible.  Due to this change and for your protection, international customers outside of Canada will be required to pay for USPS Global Express shipping ($44.95), which in addition to guaranteeing arrival within 3-5 business days (excepting intervention from your country’s customs department), also can be tracked and insured.  I wish I could offer a more economical solution, but cheaper options are too risky.\n\nInternational customers are responsible for all fees associated with shipping to their respective countries. Orders that are shipped to countries outside of the United States may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country. The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such import taxes, customs duties and fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; I have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond the original delivery estimates. It is against the law and I will not mark an item as a &quot;gift&quot; to avoid any fees.",

"sale_message": "Below are some very important policies that I hope will not be relevant to your order (because they are only relevant when something is wrong). PLEASE READ THEM in any case.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGARDING RETURNS: Every ring is made to order, to the exact size you provide to me.  Rings with a wood interior can be adjusted up or down by about 1/4 size, but beyond that YOUR RING CANNOT BE RESIZED.  Refunds and exchanges will not be possible, as an entirely new ring will have to be made for you.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREGARDING MODIFICATIONS: When I receive an order, even though the ship date seems far off (in practice, I often ship early), work begins on your ring immediately.  Within 48 hours, the metal for your ring has very likely already been ordered, and perhaps has already been completed. For this reason, if you need to make a change (size, width, etc.) AFTER 48 hours, there will be a charge of $30.  \r\n\r\nThank you for reading.  This is obviously an automatically generated message.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me through Etsy.  I respond fairly quickly.  If you find these policies overly draconian or otherwise problematic, please contact me as soon as possible so I can, with regret, cancel your order.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSteven Wyatt\r\nWedgeWood Rings",

"policy_refunds": "You must provide me with an accurate size. The size you order will be the size you receive.

Rings are covered against breaks due to craftsmanship for 6 months - I will replace it for no charge.  If, however, your ring meets a bad end due to an accident (smashing in a door, or any other stresses that no wooden ring could expect to withstand), no refund will be offered. ",
"policy_additional": "**FAQ**\r\n\r\nWhy wooden rings?\r\n\r\n*Plain metal is boring.\r\n\r\n*Nickel allergies are quite common, and wooden rings are a great alternative. The titanium I use is also nickel-free and hypoallergenic.\r\n\r\n*They are beautiful, and no two are the same.\r\n\r\n*They make great gifts – especially for first wedding anniversaries (for which the traditional gift is paper [close enough]) and 5th wedding anniversaries (for which the traditional gift is WOOD)\r\n\r\nHow durable are your rings?\r\n\r\nThe most important factor that determines the durability of these rings is the owner. Each ring is given multiple coats of a hybrid epoxy finish, which is completely water-proof and soap proof. As for the normal wear-and-tear from daily use, the perfect gloss will eventually become scratched (just as with metal rings), but buffing wax occasionally applied will protect the ring and its shine for years.\r\n\r\nThe titanium lined rings are unquestionably significantly stronger than rings made of wood alone. On the Moh’s Hardness Scale, Gold and Silver are around 3, Platinum 4.5, and Titanium is 6.  Any circumstances under which your Titanium is scratched, any precious metal would have been scratched all that more severely.  It is certainly not going to snap.\r\n\r\nPlease use common sense when wearing a ring with a wooden component.  WedgeWood Rings the strongest and most durable wood rings you can buy, but it is still a thin piece of wood you are wearing on your finger.  If you are going to move furniture, take it off first; if you are going to go climbing, do not wear your ring; if you are going to do some landscaping and are moving some rough stones, pocket the ring.\r\n\r\n“Hybrid Epoxy Finish”\r\n\r\nPart shameless marketing term, part description of a secret, painstakingly  brewed combination of epoxy and other finishes, this phrase describes the primary protection for the wood in your ring.  Think boat finish, thats pretty close to the meat of it.  The actual details I wouldnt tell my own mother (sorry mom!).\r\n\r\nSee this post for some more details: http://wedgewoodrings.wordpress.com/2012/07/28/the-promised-big-announcement/\r\n\r\nWhat size am I?\r\n\r\nTitanium ring sizes run from 4 to 16 including quarter sizes. I highly recommend going to a jewelry counter to determine your size, even if you already know your size. &quot;Do it yourself&quot; ring sizing methods (string, etc.) should absolutely not be trusted. Be sure to be measured using the width you plan to order. Keep a couple things in mind: your fingers are slightly swollen in the morning (don’t ask me why), your fingers are larger during warm weather, your fingers are larger after a meal (especially salty meals). This means that if you have your finger measured on a chilly evening before dinner, the result will be on the low end of your actual size.\r\n\r\n************************************ IMPORTANT INFO ****************************************\r\n\r\n****************************************************************************************************\r\n****PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BE 100% SURE OF YOUR SIZE BEFORE ORDERING *****\r\n****************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nTitanium lined wood rings cannot be resized at all! Every ring is made to the exact size provided. An error in sizing that exceeds the margin provided above will necessitate a completely new ring. Refunds and exchanges will not be possible.\r\n\r\n~~~HOW DO I CARE FOR MY RING?~~~\r\n\r\nWater is no problem, sweat is no problem. Soap, occasional Purell, no problem!  If you work in a medical field, or any other profession that necessitates that your hands come in regular contact with strong solvents, I do NOT recommend you wear your ring while engaging in these activities.  No wood finish can withstand constant contact with solvents!  \r\n\r\nYour ring maintains its protection against water and soap only as long as the finish remains!  If you damage the finish, you must contact me for refinishing, or your ring may be permanently damaged.\r\n\r\nIn terms of maintaining the beauty of the finish, you can apply wax to the wood portions with a cloth. I personally use a suspension of hard and soft waxes in mineral oil (commercially available as butcher block conditioner) because the oil carries the waxes into any scratches that may be present and makes them invisible. It is also the first line of defense against anything harmful to the finish (including the friction with your finger). If you wanted to be extremely conscientious, you could apply it very often, like every few days or so. This sounds insane (and it is not really necessary), but it is literally the work of 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nWill my ring look just like the picture?\r\n\r\nEach ring is made to order and unique. The appearance will therefore vary according to the individual characteristics of the piece of wood. However, you can be assured that each ring is made to exacting standards of beauty and durability.\r\n\r\nCan I customize my ring?\r\n\r\nThe most common customization requests are width and profile modifications.\r\n\r\nWIDTH: I strive for “normal” proportions. I know that is unhelpful, so here is a rough guide: \r\n\r\nNOTE ON WIDTH:\r\n\r\nThe minimum width for the WOOD EXTERIOR style is 4mm.  The maximum is 8mm.\r\nThe minimum width for the WOOD INTERIOR style is 5mm. The maximum is 8mm.\r\n\r\nRecommended width is calculated in this way: Size 5 is 5mm wide. Width increases .5mm per size above that. So:\r\n\r\nSize 5- 5mm\r\nSize 6 - 5.5mm\r\nSize 7- 6mm\r\nSize 8 - 6.5mm\r\nSize 9- 7mm\r\nSize 10 - 7.5mm\r\nSize 11+- 8mm\r\n\r\nPROFILE: By default, my rings have a lightly sloping dome shape– a traditional ring profile. Some people prefer a flat profile, and that is no problem. Just put your profile requests in the &quot;note to wedgewoodrings&quot; section at checkout.\r\n\r\nEngraving?\r\n\r\nI do not offer engraving for my rings. For the wood exterior rings you can get it engraved, however I do not recommend it. A jeweler can engrave titanium, but I do not know what clamping methods they might use. Because the vast majority of jewelers will be unfamiliar with wood and wood finish, they might damage it. Such damage would absolutely not be covered by warranty.\r\n\r\nWhere do you get your wood?\r\n\r\nExotic wood dealers on Ebay mainly. In some cases, I use found wood. I’ve even been known to raid roadside piles of cutoffs.\r\n\r\nCan you do custom orders using [insert wood/ wood combination here]?\r\n\r\nI certainly can if I have the wood. If I don’t have the wood, I may be able to get it. Send me an email with what you have in mind.\r\n\r\nSome examples of previous orders: ring made from the wood of an old house, ring made with sand from the honeymooners’ beach; ring made from a skateboard; ring made from a tree on the family farm.",

"description": "This is a very unique liquor bottle that is tall and slender, shaped like a pitcher and features a glass stopper with a crest on each side. The bottle also has a gold crest on one side. The stopper is lined with cork which does show age, primarily on the bottom. Aside from needing a good cleaning, there are no chips or cracks. The height with stopper in place is 12 inches, the bottom is just over 3 3/4 inches wide. A great addition to any decanter collection or could be used as a vase as well.\r\n\r\nWe ship internationally. Please message us with your address and we can figure shipping.\r\n\r\nThanks for viewing this listing.

As colors vary depending on lighting and computers, no returns will be accepted based on color discrepancies. In clothing and accessories, please base your buying decisions on the actual measurements provided instead of the stated size as sizes have changed over the decades. \r\n\r\nErrors or omissions in descriptions are unintentional, not made to mislead or deceive.  If there is a major discrepancy between our description plus pictures versus the item you received, we will allow you to return the item.

We do not accept returns for buyers remorse.\r\n\r\n&quot;IF&quot; a return is authorized, items must be returned within (5) days of receipt and in the same condition as sent.

If you absolutely require a tracking number from the US Mail, please let us know in a convo prior to placing your order, and we will let you know if an extra fee applies.  \r\n\r\nWhen delivering to residences, it is UPS and the US Mail&#39;s policy to not require a signature.  Should you require someone to sign for the package(s) please let us know and we can let you know what the additional cost would be.\r\n\r\nThe addressee MUST BE KNOWN by the Post Office, UPS, FED-EX or other delivery service to reside at the address you are shipping to.  If the addressee is not known to reside there, you MUST address the label with a C/O (care of) someone that is known to reside there.\r\n\r\nIf you have us ship to an address, and the Post Office deems it to be UNDERLIVERABLE or UNDELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED or some similar terminology, and we have addressed the package as you have instructed, our obligation has been completed at that point.  Should the package be returned to us, we will contact you with a new shipping price to re-mail it to you.  Should the package not be returned to us, or returned damage, we will not be responsible for any refund or replacement of any amount.\r\n\r\nLOST PACKAGES SHIPPED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES:\r\nIf your package does not arrive by the estimated date provided by the post office, UPS or other delivery service, we will decide to either replace or refund your purchase 14 business days, excluding holidays, after the delivery service&#39;s estimated delivery date.  The only exception would be FIRST CLASS MAIL, which would be 21 business days, excluding holidays.  This will be an allowable timeframe for misrouted packages to arrive to you.\r\n\r\nWe have had instances where packages delivered to apartment buildings were delayed as the mailman decided not to leave the package in the hallway unattended.\r\n\r\nWhen we send you the shipping convo, it would be a good idea to arrange to have the package delivered to a neighbor (leave a note for the mailman) or ask the post office to hold any packages at the post office for you to pickup.\r\n\r\nUPS WILL LEAVE packages unattended, so you should definately arrange to be home or leave a note for the UPS driver to deliver to a neighbor.  The neighbor would need to be a next door apt as UPS will not deliver to another building free of charge.\r\n\r\nCANADIAN and INTERNATIONAL shipments: If you require a tracking number, UPS is the only option. Please contact us to see if the shipping charges shown in the listing is for UPS or Mail. Any duties and taxes will be the responsibility of the customer.  Shipments made to Canada or Internationally by a service other than UPS (ie: Postal Service) are not guarranteed as the tracking numbers are only good until the package reaches the US border, then the receiving country takes control.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSURANCE:  \r\nAll shipments ARE NOT insured.  Should you require insurance for lost packages, damage, etc, let us know prior to placing your order so we may give you a price.  Any packages delivered to you in a damaged condition MUST be reported to the delivery person BEFORE YOU SIGN for the package.  Any damaged packages that have not been reported to the delivery person before you sign, will not be refunded or exchanged by us.",

If there is a damaged product, you will need to send us photograph(s) clearly showing the damage.  We can instruct you as to what we need for photographs based on the product.  If a refund is issued we may require a photo showing the product is no longer usable.  This would require a photograph showing the engraving or other part of the product marred, scratched or otherwise rendered unusable.

"title": "Titanium Wood Ring Lined With Whiskey Barrel White Oak Stave",
"description": "This ring also comes in Cobalt, which is more scratch resistant and the color of white gold:\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/197327996/cobalt-wooden-ring-lined-with-jack\n\nThe inner liner of this ring is made from a genuine used Jack Daniels Whiskey white oak barrel. Almost as much work goes into perfecting the Jack Daniels barrel as does perfecting the iconic American whiskey. Carefully selected American White Oak is slowly dried outdoors for nearly a year. After being exposed to the rain and sun, it is kiln dried, assembled, and then charred to release the naturally occurring flavors that will be imparted to the whiskey. Though the blanks reek of whiskey, the final products (sadly, from an authenticity perspective) have no odor, having been sealed with finish.  \n\nI have a few other barrel wood options besides Jack Daniels, including Jim Beam, Maker&#39;s Mark, and Buffalo Trace. Please see this blog post to see what I mean:\n\nhttp://www.wedgewoodrings.com/blog/2014/4/27/barrel-staves-and-the-many-options-at-our-disposal\n\nJACK DANIEL&#39;S is a registered trademark and is not involved in or affiliated with the production or distribution of this product!\n\nThe titanium in this wooden ring is 6al-4v grade 5 titanium, preferred among jewelers. The ring pictured is a stone finish, but satin and polished finishes are also available (message for details). \n\nTitanium ring sizes run from 4 to 16 including quarter sizes. I highly recommend going to a jewelry counter to determine your size, even if you already know your size.  &quot;Do it yourself&quot; ring sizing methods (string, etc.) should absolutely not be trusted. Be sure to be measured using the width you plan to order.  Include a custom finish/profile in the &quot;note to wedgewoodrings&quot; section at checkout.\n\n+++SEE SHOP ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THE SHOP PAGE FOR CURRENT SHIP DATE+++\n\nNOTE ON WIDTH:\n\nThe minimum width for this style is 5mm.  The maximum is 8mm.\n\nRecommended width is calculated in this way: Size 5 is 5mm wide. Width increases .5mm per size above that. So:\n\nSize 5- 5mm\nSize 7- 6mm\nSize 9- 7mm\nSize 11+- 8mm\n\n************************************ IMPORTANT INFO ****************************************\n\n****************************************************************************************************\n****PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BE 100% SURE OF YOUR SIZE BEFORE ORDERING *****\n****************************************************************************************************\n\nTitanium lined wood rings cannot be resized at all! Every ring is made to the exact size provided. An error in sizing that exceeds the margin provided above will necessitate a completely new ring. Refunds and exchanges will not be possible.\n\nPlease click on the &quot;Policies&quot; link (under Shop Info) to see wood ring care instructions and FAQ.\n\nEach ring is given multiple coats of a hybrid epoxy finish, which is completely water-proof and soap proof. This protective coating is sanded up to 12,000 grit for an unbelievable, glass-like finish.\n\nAll rings ship via USPS Priority (or Priority International) Small Flat Rate Box. If you are outside the US and Canada, your only shipping option is Global Express.  Please read below for details.  Insurance is mandatory for this ring, and included in the shipping charge. You pay what I pay for shipping, nothing more.\n\nFor customers outside the US:\n\nDue to changes in USPS policy, international packages sent to countries other than Canada can no longer be tracked past the US border.  Insurance claims are also not possible.  Due to this change and for your protection, international customers outside of Canada will be required to pay for USPS Global Express shipping ($44.95), which in addition to guaranteeing arrival within 3-5 business days (excepting intervention from your country’s customs department), also can be tracked and insured.  I wish I could offer a more economical solution, but cheaper options are too risky.\n\nInternational customers are responsible for all fees associated with shipping to their respective countries. Orders that are shipped to countries outside of the United States may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country. The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such import taxes, customs duties and fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by the recipient; I have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. When customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond the original delivery estimates. It is against the law and I will not mark an item as a &quot;gift&quot; to avoid any fees.",

PLEASE READ THEM in any case.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGARDING RETURNS: Every ring is made to order, to the exact size you provide to me.  Rings with a wood interior can be adjusted up or down by about 1/4 size, but beyond that YOUR RING CANNOT BE RESIZED.  Refunds and exchanges will not be possible, as an entirely new ring will have to be made for you.  \r\n\r\n\r\nREGARDING MODIFICATIONS: When I receive an order, even though the ship date seems far off (in practice, I often ship early), work begins on your ring immediately.  Within 48 hours, the metal for your ring has very likely already been ordered, and perhaps has already been completed. For this reason, if you need to make a change (size, width, etc.) AFTER 48 hours, there will be a charge of $30.  \r\n\r\nThank you for reading.  This is obviously an automatically generated message.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me through Etsy.  I respond fairly quickly.

Rings are covered against breaks due to craftsmanship for 6 months - I will replace it for no charge.  If, however, your ring meets a bad end due to an accident (smashing in a door, or any other stresses that no wooden ring could expect to withstand), no refund will be offered. ",
"policy_additional": "**FAQ**\r\n\r\nWhy wooden rings?\r\n\r\n*Plain metal is boring.\r\n\r\n*Nickel allergies are quite common, and wooden rings are a great alternative. The titanium I use is also nickel-free and hypoallergenic.\r\n\r\n*They are beautiful, and no two are the same.\r\n\r\n*They make great gifts – especially for first wedding anniversaries (for which the traditional gift is paper [close enough]) and 5th wedding anniversaries (for which the traditional gift is WOOD)\r\n\r\nHow durable are your rings?\r\n\r\nThe most important factor that determines the durability of these rings is the owner. Each ring is given multiple coats of a hybrid epoxy finish, which is completely water-proof and soap proof. As for the normal wear-and-tear from daily use, the perfect gloss will eventually become scratched (just as with metal rings), but buffing wax occasionally applied will protect the ring and its shine for years.\r\n\r\nThe titanium lined rings are unquestionably significantly stronger than rings made of wood alone. On the Moh’s Hardness Scale, Gold and Silver are around 3, Platinum 4.5, and Titanium is 6.  Any circumstances under which your Titanium is scratched, any precious metal would have been scratched all that more severely.  It is certainly not going to snap.\r\n\r\nPlease use common sense when wearing a ring with a wooden component.  WedgeWood Rings the strongest and most durable wood rings you can buy, but it is still a thin piece of wood you are wearing on your finger.  If you are going to move furniture, take it off first; if you are going to go climbing, do not wear your ring; if you are going to do some landscaping and are moving some rough stones, pocket the ring.\r\n\r\n“Hybrid Epoxy Finish”\r\n\r\nPart shameless marketing term, part description of a secret, painstakingly  brewed combination of epoxy and other finishes, this phrase describes the primary protection for the wood in your ring.  Think boat finish, thats pretty close to the meat of it.  The actual details I wouldnt tell my own mother (sorry mom!).\r\n\r\nSee this post for some more details: http://wedgewoodrings.wordpress.com/2012/07/28/the-promised-big-announcement/\r\n\r\nWhat size am I?\r\n\r\nTitanium ring sizes run from 4 to 16 including quarter sizes. I highly recommend going to a jewelry counter to determine your size, even if you already know your size. &quot;Do it yourself&quot; ring sizing methods (string, etc.) should absolutely not be trusted. Be sure to be measured using the width you plan to order. Keep a couple things in mind: your fingers are slightly swollen in the morning (don’t ask me why), your fingers are larger during warm weather, your fingers are larger after a meal (especially salty meals). This means that if you have your finger measured on a chilly evening before dinner, the result will be on the low end of your actual size.\r\n\r\n************************************ IMPORTANT INFO ****************************************\r\n\r\n****************************************************************************************************\r\n****PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BE 100% SURE OF YOUR SIZE BEFORE ORDERING *****\r\n****************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nTitanium lined wood rings cannot be resized at all! Every ring is made to the exact size provided. An error in sizing that exceeds the margin provided above will necessitate a completely new ring. Refunds and exchanges will not be possible.\r\n\r\n~~~HOW DO I CARE FOR MY RING?~~~\r\n\r\nWater is no problem, sweat is no problem. Soap, occasional Purell, no problem!  If you work in a medical field, or any other profession that necessitates that your hands come in regular contact with strong solvents, I do NOT recommend you wear your ring while engaging in these activities.  No wood finish can withstand constant contact with solvents!  \r\n\r\nYour ring maintains its protection against water and soap only as long as the finish remains!  If you damage the finish, you must contact me for refinishing, or your ring may be permanently damaged.\r\n\r\nIn terms of maintaining the beauty of the finish, you can apply wax to the wood portions with a cloth. I personally use a suspension of hard and soft waxes in mineral oil (commercially available as butcher block conditioner) because the oil carries the waxes into any scratches that may be present and makes them invisible. It is also the first line of defense against anything harmful to the finish (including the friction with your finger). If you wanted to be extremely conscientious, you could apply it very often, like every few days or so. This sounds insane (and it is not really necessary), but it is literally the work of 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nWill my ring look just like the picture?\r\n\r\nEach ring is made to order and unique. The appearance will therefore vary according to the individual characteristics of the piece of wood. However, you can be assured that each ring is made to exacting standards of beauty and durability.\r\n\r\nCan I customize my ring?\r\n\r\nThe most common customization requests are width and profile modifications.\r\n\r\nWIDTH: I strive for “normal” proportions. I know that is unhelpful, so here is a rough guide: \r\n\r\nNOTE ON WIDTH:\r\n\r\nThe minimum width for the WOOD EXTERIOR style is 4mm.  The maximum is 8mm.\r\nThe minimum width for the WOOD INTERIOR style is 5mm. The maximum is 8mm.\r\n\r\nRecommended width is calculated in this way: Size 5 is 5mm wide. Width increases .5mm per size above that. So:\r\n\r\nSize 5- 5mm\r\nSize 6 - 5.5mm\r\nSize 7- 6mm\r\nSize 8 - 6.5mm\r\nSize 9- 7mm\r\nSize 10 - 7.5mm\r\nSize 11+- 8mm\r\n\r\nPROFILE: By default, my rings have a lightly sloping dome shape– a traditional ring profile. Some people prefer a flat profile, and that is no problem. Just put your profile requests in the &quot;note to wedgewoodrings&quot; section at checkout.\r\n\r\nEngraving?\r\n\r\nI do not offer engraving for my rings. For the wood exterior rings you can get it engraved, however I do not recommend it. A jeweler can engrave titanium, but I do not know what clamping methods they might use. Because the vast majority of jewelers will be unfamiliar with wood and wood finish, they might damage it. Such damage would absolutely not be covered by warranty.\r\n\r\nWhere do you get your wood?\r\n\r\nExotic wood dealers on Ebay mainly. In some cases, I use found wood. I’ve even been known to raid roadside piles of cutoffs.\r\n\r\nCan you do custom orders using [insert wood/ wood combination here]?\r\n\r\nI certainly can if I have the wood. If I don’t have the wood, I may be able to get it. Send me an email with what you have in mind.\r\n\r\nSome examples of previous orders: ring made from the wood of an old house, ring made with sand from the honeymooners’ beach; ring made from a skateboard; ring made from a tree on the family farm.",

"policy_welcome": "Hello and welcome to our shop! My name is Amy, and my husband, Tyler and I are the owners and creators of Liquid Courage. We have been selling online since 2003. Recently, we decided to make the leap from selling items made by others to selling items that we make. We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. \r\n\r\nTyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well.  Upon graduating, we tried &quot;real, grown-up jobs&quot; - Tyler as a general manager at a greenhouse manufacturing company, and I as a staff accountant for a nationwide manufacturing company.  We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach. We chose the path less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\r\n\r\nPlease don&#39;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or would like a custom item.\r\n\r\n(888) 959-2870 (M-F 9am - 5pm Eastern)\r\nor\r\nConvo us anytime! \r\n\r\nCheers! \r\nTyler and Amy",
