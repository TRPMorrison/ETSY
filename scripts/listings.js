Please contact me with your ideas and I will be happy to create a special sculpture just for you. \r\nCustom order items require design and production time. You will receive an estimate of both time and cost upon ordering. I will create an ETSY listing just for you and must it be paid in full before I begin creating the piece.

I consider and investigate clays, glazes, and shipping materials to make informed choices and work towards a studio with zero waste.\r\nCeramic production uses a lot of energy, and many of the ingredients in glazes and the clay body itself are mined from the Earth, toxic and cancer causing in their raw form. I take steps to reduce harm to the environment and myself in my studio. Since I opened my studio I have been engaging in environmentally responsible ceramic studio practices.\r\n★ I use several different clay bodies, depending on the item. All of the clay I use is talc-free, guided by a firm commitment toward product safety. \r\n★ The glazes I use do not contain lead. I mix many of my glazes from raw materials in a well-ventilated area. After firing they are food-safe and non-toxic.\r\n★ The construction process is all by hand and doesn’t use an electric potter’s wheel or ram press.\r\n★ My kilns are oxidation, high efficiency, computerized and emit no harmful gases. \r\n\r\nP L E A S E - N O T E\r\nPart of what makes my style unique is the lovably flawed characteristics. Everything in my shop is handmade. My artwork may have tiny cracks or uneven glazed surfaces. I ensure that these imperfections will not interfere with the form or functionality, only add to the aesthetic.\r\nI do my best to capture the true color of my work in the photographs, but please note that colors may appear differently on your screen.\r\n\r\nAll work is copyright by Hadley Clay Studio 2013-2014 / All rights reserved.

    "title": "Garden Marker with Stake, Peas sign, Hand routed on 400+ year-old Cedar barn wood that was hand split 100+ years ago. Very primitive",
    "description": "This marker is cut on 400+ year-old Western Red Cedar, hand split by Finnish pioneers, well over 100-years ago.  This one measures (give or take) 1/2&quot; thick, 6&quot; tall and 10 1/2” wide.\n\nYou won’t find wood with history like this at the big box cookie cutter store.  Our garden markers are a bit more expensive, cause we don’t use a cheap piece of fence board.  We lovingly hand route the letters and don’t use a makeshift machine that cuts every letter on every marker exactly the same in 60 seconds\n\nThey come with extra stakes and brass screws.  Every garden sign we create is a different size and shape, some have nail holes and some don’t.  Very few have knots, because the old time pioneers that cut the tree down didn’t bother with the knotty wood.  Two or three trees were more than enough to build a cabin, barn and outhouse.\n\nWe have a marker for just about everything grown in a garden or orchard.  If we don’t have one you want, my wife and I will make ya one lickety-split.\n\nUntil about 30 years ago we had two cabins and a barn, then one cabin and the barn collapsed in a wind storm.  Now we are using the wood from the collapsed buildings to renovate the remaining cabin.  These markers are scraps from the ends of planks that are too long or not wide enough for our renovations.\n\nYou don’t even need to bring these signs in for the winter.  This old growth wood has been out in the weather for over 100-years and will last for another 100 or so.  When Lewis and Clark came through this area, the tree this wood came from was already very old.  Five children were born and raised in the cabin.  There was no electricity, water or toilet.  The wood cook stove (still there) was the only heat, and coal oil lanterns (still there) the only light.  There are names and dates carved all over the front face of the remaining cabin.\n\nWood like this don’t grow on trees anymore.  If ya find some, IT’S VERY SPECIAL.  We can make you another type of sign with it, but keep in mind that we will only make serious signs on this wood.  No funny, ha ha stuff.  Only, love, peace, tranquility or beauty.  As Mother Nature intended, the colors, textures, and character will be different for every piece of this beautiful wood.  Sorry if this ad rambled on a bit, but this wood gets me all excited and stuff.\n\nIf you would like to see more of our signs please visit both of our Etsy shops\nFOR CUSTOM SIGNS GO TO:\thttps://www.etsy.com/shop/SolitudeValley\nFOR READY TO GO SIGNS:\thttps://www.etsy.com/shop/tripeeesign\n00083",

My wife retired from the US Fish & Wildlife Service.  We bought ourselves a 40-acre tree farm and aptly named it Solitude Valley.  We have most things we want, all that we need, and more than we deserve.\r\n\r\nIf you are ever in our area, stop by and take a gander at the pioneer cabin, barn, outhouse and of course our wood working shop.  There is a nice little stream and river running through the property and trails that you can hike on.  The beach is about 20 minutes away.  Bring a picnic basket and pitch a tent, (we like fried chicken a lot).  Don’t pay a lick of attention to the NO TRESPASSING signs, they&#39;re for the hunters.\r\nYou won’t find us anywhere but Etsy and Craigslist.  We don’t know anything about Facebook or Twitter (old dogs, no new tricks) and sorry, but we don’t have a blog.  Blog sounds like a derogatory term for log and we don’t say nothing bad about any kind of wood, EXCEPT HOLLYWOOD!\r\n\r\nWe specialize in rustic and destination signs, but we make many other things from wood.  We email and send pictures, as we go, and when we finish.  Nail and worm holes are free, knots and knotty wood are not.  Wood is wood, unless it’s knot wood.  Why not?\r\n\r\nI peck on the computer, cut and sand the wood then design the signs, and my wife brings them to life with chisels, router, paint and the like.  We take pride in what we make from start to finish and hope you fall in love with what you buy from us.  We enjoy making signs, so we know you will enjoy owning one.  Please let us know what you need and we will figure out a way to make it happen.\r\n\r\nMy wife says that all proceeds go to her and/or she ain&#39;t gonna give me none.\r\n\r\nLearn more about us on our about page.\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/SolitudeValley/about\r\nLearn even more about us on our profile page.\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/people/solitudevalleyfarm\r\nThen check out our shop policies prior to ordering.\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/SolitudeValley/policy\r\nGot nothin’ better to do, check out our other Etsy shop\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/tripeeesign \r\n",

We discovered a love for natural wood and a hidden talent making unique things with it.  Our sign creations are handmade mostly from finders’ keepers, recycled and blown down tree wood, but we use new wood if you insist.  We have many species of wood; a lot is unidentifiable, totally unique, and beautiful.  We have a complete pioneer farm, including cabin, barn, outhouse and out buildings just waiting to be reused.  In our shop, you will find a variety of handmade woodcraft&#39;s, from custom hand routed wood signs (OUR SPECIALTY), to Lucky Cluck chicken coops.  Besides what we have posted, we will CUSTOM make any sign you would like.  Because of the care, we put into all our creations, typical custom production time is about 2 weeks or longer if we have a backlog.\r\n  \r\nFor those without common sense, the sign stand and/or trees in the background are not included with our signs. \r\n",

We live and work way out in the woods, and only go to town one day a week.  When we finish making your sign, it will take from 1 to 7 days before we can ship it.  We moved to the country to slow down, so we won’t hurry any part of our process.  It just wouldn’t be any fun for us.\r\nOn the other hand, we may have to go on an emergency wood finding mission and might stop by the Post office.",

We do not give refunds on custom and rush orders unless you have a damn good reason.  JUST KIDDING, if you don’t like the sign we made for you, we will give your money back, shipping included.  Convo us and we will tell you about how we do that.",
      "policy_additional": "In the future, we would like to take all international orders.  Just as soon as we figure out a way to make more signs, without sacrificing the quality and workmanship we require of ourselves.  We have our eye on a few, woodworking for fun type people that we have been talking with.  Keep checking back.  Your American dream sign may soon be a reality.  We are now shipping to Canada, if you live there, when we get your address we will give you the shipping cost. ",

    "description": "First picture is larger cutting from original tree as an example, the 2nd and 3rd picture are examples of the 4 inch option and the 4th and 5th picture are examples of the 2 inch option.\n\nThe jade plant is an evergreen with thick branches. It has thick, shiny, smooth, leaves that grow in opposing pairs along the branches. Leaves are a rich jade green, although some may appear to be more of a yellow-green and may develop a red tinge on the edges of leaves when exposed to high levels of sunlight. \n\nWatering a Jade Plant\nOne of the most important things when you care for jade plants is to make sure that they are watered properly. Never let a jade plant dry out completely. But also, do not water a jade plant too often, as this can cause root rot. Don’t water your jade plant on a schedule. Rather, water your jade plant when the top of soil is just dry to the touch.\n\nSunlight Requirements of a Jade Plant\nAnother important aspect of the care and maintenance of jade plants is how much sun they receive. They need full sun in order to grow properly. If they do not have full sun, they may become stunted and leggy.\n\nProper Temperature for Jade Plants\nJade plant care instructions say that jade plants do best in day time temperatures of 65-75 F. (18-24 C.) during the day and 50-55 F. (10-13 C.) at night. That being said, if they get lots of sunlight, they will do fine in temperatures that are higher than this.\n\nFertilizing Your Jade Plant\nFor proper jade plant care, fertilize your jade plant about once every six months. Use a balanced water soluble fertilizer. An important thing to keep in mind is that you should water your jade plant in the regular way and then water it with the fertilizer water. Never fertilize your jade plant when the soil is dry, as this will damage the roots.",

      "policy_welcome": "Succulents, from the Latin word ‘succos’, meaning juice, are drought tolerant plants that come in a variety of attractive colors, fascinating shapes, interesting textures and a wide array of sizes. Some are soft and furry, while others are hard and spiky. Others are bright in color, while some mimic the appearance of small stones. Succulents have the unique ability to store moisture in their succulent tissue that either occurs in their leaves, stems or roots. Whether purchasing only a handful, or a complete set, you’re sure to fall in love with the character and beauty of each of our offered succulents!\r\n\r\nSucculents should be watered generously in the summer. The potting mix should be allowed to dry between waterings, but do not underwater. During the winter, when the plants go dormant, cut watering back to once every other month. Overwatering and ensuing plant rot is the single most common cause of plant failure. Be aware, though, that an overwatered succulent might at first plump up and look very healthy. However, the cause of death may have already set in underground, with rot spreading upward from the root system. A succulent should never be allowed to sit in water.",
      "policy_payment": "TheSucculence accepts Paypal and all major credit cards. All purchases and reserve listings must be paid within 3 days unless other arrangements are made. Non-payment will result in cancellation. Special orders require a $50 deposit to reserve your succulents for a later date. Deposits are refundable up to one month before your ship date.Cancellation after that time frame deposits are not refundable, due to the fact that plants have been reserved.\r\nCalifornia residents must pay 8% in sales tax. It will be added to your invoice when checking out.",
      "policy_shipping": "We ship via USPS 2-3 day priority mail. Boxes should be opened and plants unwrapped upon receipt. Succulent plants can lose their color and, as with all living plants, they really prefer to get out of their boxes and into a great cactus soil. Any of the listings that state plants are shipped bare root means that they are out of pots and with very little soil. While they make the trip fine that way, it is best to plan for their arrival and have planting plans in place.\r\n\r\nEtsy and Paypal addresses much match. We are not responsible if the package is sent to an incorrect address, so please make sure of the accuracy of the shipping address. I do not customarily provide for a signature confirmation or insurance on your order, although it is available upon request. Lost or stolen packages are not my responsibility once your order has been shipped.",
      "policy_refunds": "All plants are of the best possible quality. If you are dissatisfied in any way with your plants, please contact me within 24 hours of delivery. All shipments are carefully wrapped to make sure that they arrive in great shape. We have no control over your shipment once it has has been shipped and are not responsible for lost, or damaged items. When shipped in their pots, soil can l get loose from the pot. Brush off the plant or blow lightly to remove this loose soil from your plant, replace the soil around the roots.\r\n",
      "policy_additional": "f you need a larger quantity than I have listed, please send me a convo and I will quote you a price. Succulents make beautiful living favors for wedding receptions, showers, garden parties and other special events!",

    "title": "Indoor/Outdoor Living wall. 100% Handmade Cedar Succulent Hanging Planter. Awesome Gift!",
    "description": "This is for a Handmade Cedar framed vertical succulent garden a.k.a. Living Wall. This handmade Living Wall measures approximately 10&quot; x 30&quot; x 4&quot; and is constructed completely from hand stained Cedar wood. It comes with adequate drainage holes on the back, an attached wall hanger, and comes already planted with living rooting succulents. This Living Wall can be hung either vertical or horizontal.\r\n\r\nBring it indoors and improve your quality of life! Living Walls add a very unique and cool charm to any home setting as well as any outdoor environment. They are great for hanging inside or outside.\r\n\r\nRedwood or Cedar is optional, as well as color variation, since all this work is custom done by myself. If this Stained Cedar frame isn&#39;t you, just let me know what you&#39;re looking for, and I&#39;ll gladly make it! I encourage the challenge!\r\n\r\nCaring for your Living Wall:\r\nThis Living wall and these succulent plants are extremely easy to maintain! Water when plants/medium look dry, about every week or so. When watering is needed, just remove from the wall and heavily mist plants and moss till wet. Allow the Living Wall to properly drain, let it dry, and rehang! We also include instructions for watering, pruning, and caring for your living wall when purchased.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor optimal life, place in a location with great indirect light or good morning sunshine.\r\n\r\n**The one pictured is an example of what yours will look like but with some slight flower and wood stain variations**\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Due to the large amount of orders this item won&#39;t be ready to ship  for 1-2 business weeks. . It takes time, these are 100% handmade and planted***\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for checking out my work.

I will begin making your Living wall asap and as soon as it&#39;s in the post I will be sending you a confirmation message with tracking number for your records. \r\n\r\nWhen you receive the item, it is best to give it up to a week + laying on its back in a nice warm sunny environment to help increase the rooting process. After your Living wall has had time to acclimate, it’s time to find it a nice bright, sunny home. Ideally, it likes bright light with partial sun. Too much sun can cause the leaves to burn, so early morning sunlight or indirect afternoon light is best.\r\n \r\nSucculents love water but hate to be regularly wet! So this means water occasionally but let the soil dry in-between watering. If the soil is to wet, the roots can rot and the plants will not flourish. For watering, first check the soil/moss to see if it needs watering. If it feels a little damp, leave it be. Only water if the soil is completely dry. If dry, remove and mist the moss/soil heavily till completely damp. Allow proper time for it to completely drain before rehanging, wipe off excess water, and rehang!\r\n\r\nSucculents are low-maintenance and loyal. Just pick a spot with sunlight, water occasionally, and watch them grow! \r\n\r\nI also do custom orders and larger orders for weddings, parties, offices, and events all at competitive pricing. Please inquire within for any special requests.\r\n\r\nThanks for shopping! I&#39;ll be in contact shortly.\r\n\r\nNed\r\nOne with Plants\r\n\r\n",

Below are care instructions so that you can print them out. Thanks.\r\n\r\nSUCCULENT PLANT CARE\r\n\r\n1. SOIL\r\nUse the correct potting soil mix. Purchase a mixture specifically designed for cactus and succulents or mix one part sand, one part pea gravel and one part indoor potting soil. Succulents will not grow well in soil that is too rich.\r\n2. WATER \r\nWater sparingly!!! Most succulents need to be watered only once every 10 days or even less often. Be sure to water thoroughly until it runs out of the bottom of the pot. Do not let the pots sit in the drained water. If you notice leaves on your succulents getting soft and exuding liquid, they are suffering from too much water. Make adjustments accordingly.\r\n3. GRAVEL\r\nPlace a layer of pea gravel on top of the soil in your pot. This will keep the top of the soil from drying out before the interior soil, which helps to avoid overwatering.\r\n4. LIGHT \r\nProvide your succulents with the right type of lighting. Succulents love and need bright light, but they do not like being under the scorching hot sun for long hours in the summer. If the side of your succulent that is facing the window turns red, tan or yellow or appears indented, it is in a place that gets too much light. If new growth is pale green and appears elongated, it needs to be moved to a place where it gets more light.\r\n5. FERTILIZE \r\nFertilize with a low nitrogen liquid fertilizer (for example, 5-10-10). The first number on the fertilizer label denotes the nitrogen content. Get one whose first number is lower than the other two. Apply fertilizer at one-quarter the manufacturer&#39;s recommended rate. OR not at all.\r\n6. AIR\r\nGive succulents enough air movement, but keep them away from cold winter drafts. Place them so they are not too close together and the air is free to move around them. During winter, occasionally run a fan in the room they are in.\r\n7. REST \r\nGive succulents a rest during the lower light levels of winter. Reduce watering to once a month or less, depending on the needs of your plant. If it looks wilted or if the soil is very dry, water more often. If the soil is still moist an inch below the surface after a month, hold off on watering. Stop fertilizing from late fall through early spring, because the plants won&#39;t be putting on enough growth to need it. Resume watering and fertilizing when your succulents begin more active and robust growth in the longer days of spring.\r\n\r\n",
