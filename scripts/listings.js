"title": "Dwarf Lychee (Litchi chinensis) Tree SEEDS: The Best Kept Ancient Chinese Secret",
"description": "Dwarf Lychee (Litchi chinensis) Tree SEEDS: The Best Kept Ancient Chinese Secret\n\nThis Self Pollinating Lychee has a lush, dark green foliage that adds great contrast to the Lychee (or litchi) fruits that hang in bunches like giant, rose colored grapes.  The tree is admired both for its tempting fruit as well as the tree’s distinctive visual appeal.  If your imagination came up with its own fruit with the perfect flavor, it would be the Lychee.  It’s no wonder many Asian restaurants serve them sometimes accompanied by ice cream after a satisfying meal.  A rugged outer skin flakes away easily revealing the delicate, velvety fruit that waits beneath the skin.  Bite into the moist, sweet flesh and experience the rush of exotic flavor unique to the Lychee fruit.  \n\nSo different in taste, the Lychee’s white, somewhat translucent flesh almost defies description.  Some say the taste is like combining the flavors of pear, grape and coconut milk all in one fruit.  Lychees are easy to prepare and taste delicious when eaten chilled.  \n \nLychees are very good for you. Seven lychees have as much vitamin C as a small orange which is 100 per cent of the recommended daily intake of vitamin C!\n\n- Pack of 5 seeds –",

"description": "Sweet “Sylvia” Upright Cherry (Prunus avium) Tree - Self-fertile Dwarf Tree SEEDS.\n\nThe “Sylvia” is an early blooming that brings delicate spring cherry blossom followed by a mass of delicious fruit in July! This mid-season cherry is a naturally compact variety with an upright growth. It produces a dark red heart-shaped fruit that is of high quality for fresh eating and equally well-suited for canning, drying, or freezing. Although, by mid-summer, you’ll be picking more cherries than you can eat!\nAlso, unlike most sweet cherries, Sylvia is self-fertile and is also an excellent pollinator for other varieties.\n*****Hardiness Zone 5 to 8*****\n\n– Pack of 6 seeds – “Germination instructions included in package”",

"description": "RARE Dwarf Longan “Sri Chompoo” aka Dragon Eye Translucent Flesh Fruit SEEDS\n\n &quot;Dragon Eye&quot; is so named because it resembles an eyeball when its fruit is shelled (the black seed shows through the translucent flesh like a pupil/iris).\n\nLongan Sri Chompoo “Dimocarpus longan”, a very rare and highly sought after compact growing selection of longan sourced from Thailand. This makes the longan suitable for some backyard gardens limited in space. Grows to 3&#39; to 5&#39; in a container! Containers help save space in your garden by utilizing your patio or even balcony space!\n \nSome people don&#39;t like the lychee fruit, complaining that it is too sweet, but the longan fruit has just enough tartness and muskiness to make it more palatable. However, it is still sweet with a pleasant aroma. Longan has a translucent flesh that has grape-like texture. It is related to the lychee, and also similar in that it grows on trees in bunches.\n \nThe tree forms a dense, round or oblong canopy of evergreen foliage. The bark is rough and corky. Glossy, dark green leaflets grow in pairs on opposite sides of leaf stems. Each stem hold six to nine pairs of 6 to 8 inch leaflets. The oblong or lancet-shaped foliage is tough and leathery with wavy margins. Flowering occurs around March, and fruits ripen from July to September.\n \n*****Hardiness Zone 10 to 11*****\n– Pack of 5 seeds – “Germination instructions and growing Guide included in package”",

"description": "Extremely Dwarf Musa “Truly Tiny” Edible Banana (Musa acuminata) Tree Seeds – Indoor Outdoor Plant    \n\nThis extremely Dwarf Musa “Truly Tiny” species grows vigorously and produce small fruit similar to Dwarf Cavendish. Forget about huge banana plants that need a lot of room. This unique Extreme Dwarf allows for growing inside the home, on the porch, or on a patio. It has a very symmetrical and compact appearance.\n\nHowever, the plant &quot;Truly Tiny&quot; do not exhibit characteristics completely consistent with the Dwarf Cavendish. The maximum height for this variety is between 24 and 30 inches, which makes “Truly Tiny” the shortest banana species.\n\nDue to its compactness, Musa “Truly Tiny” is ideally suited as a houseplant and as a tropical accent in the garden or container. This is very similar to the Dwarf Cavendish but much shorter. Its sweet bananas are also smaller than that of the Cavendish. “Truly Tiny” is an extremely dwarf banana tree, selected for its compact size and thick foliage. \n\n*****Hardiness Zone 7 to 10*****\n\n– Pack of 5 seeds – “Germination instructions included in package”\nThese seeds are guaranteed viable. Should you have difficulties with the germination, than just contact me for a free replacement.",

"announcement": "Red Cedar Woodcraft is a craft woodshop dedicated to unique style wood planters, wood frames, and wood art.     Our website is www.RedCedarWoodcraft.com....\r\n\r\nWe strive to blend art and function.  We wish for our Wood planters, vases and frames to be stand alone art items that can sit on a table and look cool.  If you decide to add some flowers or photos, then it gets even better.\r\n\r\nWe specialize in custom sized planter...you really cannot find many people who build custom work these days !    Many of our wood planters are “compartmental&quot; and &quot;sectional” :  ones that have divided planting spaces.  \r\n\r\nSome of our larger planters are “separate & sectional”:  they have multiple separate individual planter parts that can be stacked together to form a larger planter piece.  We designed these for townhouse and condo dwellers that have limited space on their outdoor balconies.  \r\n\r\nOur wooden art and photo frames are of unique design.  We believe that the art frame should be a work of art itself... you remove the photo, and the frame can stand alone as a piece of wood art.   \r\n\r\nWe&#39;ve recently gotten into &quot;art pieces&quot;... the sculptures and wall hangings are a recent development.   The Name Shelves have been a nice addition also... popular for childrens&#39; rooms.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;ll keep designing.  You keep buying.\r\n\r\nEnjoy. \r\n\r\n",

Our website is www.RedCedarWoodcraft.com....\r\n\r\nWe strive to blend art and function.  We wish for our Wood planters, vases and frames to be stand alone art items that can sit on a table and look cool.  If you decide to add some flowers or photos, then it gets even better.\r\n\r\nWe specialize in custom sized planter...you really cannot find many people who build custom work these days !    Many of our wood planters are “compartmental&quot; and &quot;sectional” :  ones that have divided planting spaces.  \r\n\r\nSome of our larger planters are “separate & sectional”:  they have multiple separate individual planter parts that can be stacked together to form a larger planter piece.  We designed these for townhouse and condo dwellers that have limited space on their outdoor balconies.  \r\n\r\nOur wooden art and photo frames are of unique design.  We believe that the art frame should be a work of art itself... you remove the photo, and the frame can stand alone as a piece of wood art.   \r\n\r\nWe&#39;ve recently gotten into &quot;art pieces&quot;... the sculptures and wall hangings are a recent development.   The Name Shelves have been a nice addition also... popular for childrens&#39; rooms.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;ll keep designing.  You keep buying.\r\n\r\nEnjoy. \r\n\r\n",

"title": "Round Terrarium - Woodland Themed ~ Yellow Snail & Mushroom",
"description": "This adorable hanging terrarium is sure to make you smile not only because it&#39;s so sweet but because there is NO watering required and it&#39;s pretty much maintenance free!\n\nI love terrariums  but my customers would tell me that as much as they loved them they didn&#39;t like watering, keeping them clean and maintaining the plants.   So I decided to start making DRY Terrariums.  All the color and green of regular terrariums but instead I use preserved mosses and silk flowers.  I add my polymer clay miniatures to make them a bit magical and the result is a truly unique little glass world.  They are my number one seller at shows because they are delicate and adorable at the same time!\n\nDETAILS-\n\nThis Terrarium features an adorable little yellow snail with a white and blue shell.  He is sitting next to a yellow and mint green mushroom with green and natural moss and white floral touches surrounding him.  The scene is mounted on a birch wood cutting from New Hampshire.\n\nEach terrarium is handmade by me, using only my designs and imagination.\n\nAll the clay figures are handmade by me.\n\nI create the tiny worlds outside of the terrarium and like a &quot;ship-in-a-bottle&quot; I carefully place them inside.  \n\nEach scene is a ONE OF A KIND because each sculpture and scene develops organically. \n\nTerrarium is a 4&quot; round glass bubble terrarium and only weighs 7oz  (another plus to dry terrariums) \n\nIt will easily hang from a window, ceiling or whatnot quite easily by threading some twine or ribbon through the top hole. \n\nThis scene is glued in place so it will stay in the position seen in the photo.\n\nCARE:\n\nWhen you receive your terrarium, remove the protective packaging inside and simply blow into the terrarium.  This should clear any moss or debris that has settled due to shipping.\n\nDO NOT TRY TO TAKE SCENE OUT, \n\nTake glass cleaner and wipe the outside and inside if desired.  You find fingerprints on them regularly as people love to pick them up and look inside.\n\nNO WATERING\n\nNO Pruning\n\nEnjoy looking at your little scene!\n\nNotes:\n\nThese terrariums delight kids, however they are not designed as toys or intended for children.  The glass will break if dropped. \n\nIf you are a local customer you may contact me BEFORE you check out and I will remove shipping charge.\n\nI mail first class mail, if you would like to have it shipped priority the charge is $7.15 for shipping and I will need to change that before you purchase.  Just send me a conversation and I&#39;ll be happy to update for you.",

"description": "This adorable hanging terrarium is sure to make you smile not only because it&#39;s so sweet but because there is NO watering required and it&#39;s pretty much maintenance free!\n\nI love terrariums  but my customers would tell me that as much as they loved them they didn&#39;t like watering, keeping them clean and maintaining the plants.   So I decided to start making DRY Terrariums.  All the color and green of regular terrariums but instead I use preserved mosses and silk flowers.  I add my polymer clay miniatures to make them a bit magical and the result is a truly unique little glass world.  They are my number one seller at shows because they are delicate and adorable at the same time!\n\nDETAILS-\n\nThis Terrarium features one of my signature gnomes inside a MEDIUM sized teardrop terrarium with light green foliage, a red ladybug, a red mushroom, preserved moss and white flowers.   The scene is mounted on a birch wood cutting from New Hampshire.  \n\nThe terrarium is teardrop shaped and stands appox. 7&quot; tall and 3.5&quot; wide.  \n\nEach terrarium is handmade by me, using only my designs and imagination.\n\nAll the clay figures are handmade by me.\n\nI create the tiny worlds outside of the terrarium and like a &quot;ship-in-a-bottle&quot; I carefully place them inside.  \n\nI DO NOT glue the little scenes down inside the terrarium because I&#39;ve found that people like to shift them to see different parts outside of the opening.  They will not fall out, they are larger than the hole and quite happy where they are. \n\nEach scene is a ONE OF A KIND because each sculpture and scene develops organically. \n\nIt will easily hang from a window, ceiling or whatnot quite easily by threading some twine or ribbon through the top hole. \n\nCARE:\n\nWhen you receive your terrarium, remove the protective packaging inside and simply blow into the terrarium.  This should clear any moss or debris that has settled due to shipping.\n\nPut your thumb and finger inside and shift the scene in the direction you most like.  DO NOT TRY TO TAKE SCENE OUT, this will likely result in your scene breaking as you force it out of the hole.\n\nTake glass cleaner and wipe the outside and inside if desired.  You find fingerprints on them regularly as people love to pick them up and look inside.\n\nNO WATERING\n\nNO Pruning\n\nEnjoy looking at your little scene!\n\nNotes:\n\nYou will receive the  EXACT terrarium pictured.\n\nThese terrariums delight kids, however they are not designed as toys or intended for children.  The glass will break if dropped. \n\nIf you are a local customer you may contact me BEFORE you check out and I will remove shipping charge.\n\nI mail first class mail, if you would like to have it shipped priority the charge is $7.15 for shipping and I will need to change that before you purchase.

"title": "Round Terrarium - Woodland Themed ~ Lady Bug ~ Mushrooms",
"description": "This adorable hanging terrarium is sure to make you smile not only because it&#39;s so sweet but because there is NO watering required and it&#39;s pretty much maintenance free!\n\nI love terrariums  but my customers would tell me that as much as they loved them they didn&#39;t like watering, keeping them clean and maintaining the plants.   So I decided to start making DRY Terrariums.  All the color and green of regular terrariums but instead I use preserved mosses and silk flowers.  I add my polymer clay miniatures to make them a bit magical and the result is a truly unique little glass world.  They are my number one seller at shows because they are delicate and adorable at the same time!\n\nDETAILS-\n\nThis Terrarium features an adorable little ladybug nestled in hill of moss and red mushrooms.   There are tiny white and yellow  flowers, green and natural moss, a green fern and real bark with dried lichen.  The scene is mounted on a birch wood cutting from New Hampshire.\n\nEach terrarium is handmade by me, using only my designs and imagination.\n\nAll the clay figures are handmade by me.\n\nI create the tiny worlds outside of the terrarium and like a &quot;ship-in-a-bottle&quot; I carefully place them inside.  \n\nI DO NOT glue the little scenes down inside the terrarium because I&#39;ve found that people like to shift them to see different parts outside of the opening.  They will not fall out, they are larger than the hole and quite happy where they are. \n\nEach scene is a ONE OF A KIND because each sculpture and scene develops organically. \n\nTerrarium is a 4&quot; round glass bubble terrarium and only weighs 7oz  (another plus to dry terrariums) \n\nIt will easily hang from a window, ceiling or whatnot quite easily by threading some twine or ribbon through the top hole. \n\nCARE:\n\nWhen you receive your terrarium, remove the protective packaging inside and simply blow into the terrarium.  This should clear any moss or debris that has settled due to shipping.\n\nPut your thumb and finger inside and shift the scene in the direction you most like.  DO NOT TRY TO TAKE SCENE OUT, this will likely result in your scene breaking as you force it out of the hole.\n\nTake glass cleaner and wipe the outside and inside if desired.  You find fingerprints on them regularly as people love to pick them up and look inside.\n\nNO WATERING\n\nNO Pruning\n\nEnjoy looking at your little scene!\n\nNotes:\n\nYou will receive the Terrarium with yellow accents and green lichen bark.  The other one pictured has sold. \n\nThese terrariums delight kids, however they are not designed as toys or intended for children.  The glass will break if dropped. \n\nIf you are a local customer you may contact me BEFORE you check out and I will remove shipping charge.\n\nI mail first class mail, if you would like to have it shipped priority the charge is $7.15 for shipping and I will need to change that before you purchase.  Just send me a conversation and I&#39;ll be happy to update for you.",

"description": "PACKAGE INCLUDES: \n\n5 Sago Palm (Cycas) Seeds \n\n\n○ GROWING METHOD \n\nStep 1 \n\nFill a gallon-sized pot with soilless potting mix to within an inch of the pot&#39;s brim. \n\nStep 2 \n\nClean the seed if it was not harvested immediately prior to you planting it. Using a knife, cut into the fibrous husk that covers the seed and peel it off to reveal the smooth seed inside. \n\nStep 3 \n\nBury the seed in the soilless potting mix to a depth so that its top surface is just barely visible. \n\nStep 4 \n\nWater the pot twice a day or as necessary to keep the top couple of inches of potting mix moist. \n\nStep 5 \n\nPlace the pot in a brightly lit area that is out of direct sunlight. For the best germination rates, maintain a temperature around the pot of 25-27°C (80-85°F). The areca palm will typically germinate within two to six weeks. \n\nNB: If not planting your seeds straight away. It is recommended that they are cleaned by peeling off their outer husk, then putting them in a breathable bag at a temperature of 20-22°C (73°F) for up to 12 months.",

"description": "Dwarf Lychee (Litchi chinensis) Tree SEEDS: The Best Kept Ancient Chinese Secret\n\nThis Self Pollinating Lychee has a lush, dark green foliage that adds great contrast to the Lychee (or litchi) fruits that hang in bunches like giant, rose colored grapes.  The tree is admired both for its tempting fruit as well as the tree’s distinctive visual appeal.  If your imagination came up with its own fruit with the perfect flavor, it would be the Lychee.  It’s no wonder many Asian restaurants serve them sometimes accompanied by ice cream after a satisfying meal.  A rugged outer skin flakes away easily revealing the delicate, velvety fruit that waits beneath the skin.  Bite into the moist, sweet flesh and experience the rush of exotic flavor unique to the Lychee fruit.  \n\nSo different in taste, the Lychee’s white, somewhat translucent flesh almost defies description.  Some say the taste is like combining the flavors of pear, grape and coconut milk all in one fruit.  Lychees are easy to prepare and taste delicious when eaten chilled.  \n \nLychees are very good for you. Seven lychees have as much vitamin C as a small orange which is 100 per cent of the recommended daily intake of vitamin C!\n\n- Pack of 5 seeds –",

"description": "Sweet “Sylvia” Upright Cherry (Prunus avium) Tree - Self-fertile Dwarf Tree SEEDS.\n\nThe “Sylvia” is an early blooming that brings delicate spring cherry blossom followed by a mass of delicious fruit in July! This mid-season cherry is a naturally compact variety with an upright growth. It produces a dark red heart-shaped fruit that is of high quality for fresh eating and equally well-suited for canning, drying, or freezing. Although, by mid-summer, you’ll be picking more cherries than you can eat!\nAlso, unlike most sweet cherries, Sylvia is self-fertile and is also an excellent pollinator for other varieties.\n*****Hardiness Zone 5 to 8*****\n\n– Pack of 6 seeds – “Germination instructions included in package”",

"title": "RARE Dwarf Longan “Sri Chompoo” aka Dragon Eye Exotic Fruit SEEDS in container",
"description": "RARE Dwarf Longan “Sri Chompoo” aka Dragon Eye Translucent Flesh Fruit SEEDS\n\n &quot;Dragon Eye&quot; is so named because it resembles an eyeball when its fruit is shelled (the black seed shows through the translucent flesh like a pupil/iris).\n\nLongan Sri Chompoo “Dimocarpus longan”, a very rare and highly sought after compact growing selection of longan sourced from Thailand. This makes the longan suitable for some backyard gardens limited in space. Grows to 3&#39; to 5&#39; in a container! Containers help save space in your garden by utilizing your patio or even balcony space!\n \nSome people don&#39;t like the lychee fruit, complaining that it is too sweet, but the longan fruit has just enough tartness and muskiness to make it more palatable. However, it is still sweet with a pleasant aroma. Longan has a translucent flesh that has grape-like texture. It is related to the lychee, and also similar in that it grows on trees in bunches.\n \nThe tree forms a dense, round or oblong canopy of evergreen foliage. The bark is rough and corky. Glossy, dark green leaflets grow in pairs on opposite sides of leaf stems. Each stem hold six to nine pairs of 6 to 8 inch leaflets. The oblong or lancet-shaped foliage is tough and leathery with wavy margins. Flowering occurs around March, and fruits ripen from July to September.\n \n*****Hardiness Zone 10 to 11*****\n– Pack of 5 seeds – “Germination instructions and growing Guide included in package”",

"description": "Extremely Dwarf Musa “Truly Tiny” Edible Banana (Musa acuminata) Tree Seeds – Indoor Outdoor Plant    \n\nThis extremely Dwarf Musa “Truly Tiny” species grows vigorously and produce small fruit similar to Dwarf Cavendish. Forget about huge banana plants that need a lot of room. This unique Extreme Dwarf allows for growing inside the home, on the porch, or on a patio. It has a very symmetrical and compact appearance.\n\nHowever, the plant &quot;Truly Tiny&quot; do not exhibit characteristics completely consistent with the Dwarf Cavendish. The maximum height for this variety is between 24 and 30 inches, which makes “Truly Tiny” the shortest banana species.\n\nDue to its compactness, Musa “Truly Tiny” is ideally suited as a houseplant and as a tropical accent in the garden or container. This is very similar to the Dwarf Cavendish but much shorter. Its sweet bananas are also smaller than that of the Cavendish. “Truly Tiny” is an extremely dwarf banana tree, selected for its compact size and thick foliage. \n\n*****Hardiness Zone 7 to 10*****\n\n– Pack of 5 seeds – “Germination instructions included in package”\nThese seeds are guaranteed viable.

"description": "An early and productive fruiter, Khon kaen has a dwarf tree form and is heat-tolerant. An excellent papaya for southern gardens or as a tropical container fruiting plant in the north. The dwarf tree starts to flower and set fruit within 8 months when the plant reaches 24&quot; tall !  Khon kaen is  self-fertile whose fruits often weigh 3-7 pounds. Four-pound fruits are more common for container grown plants. The oblong papaya is yellow-golden, very sweet and juicy when ripe. Rich in vitamins A, C and other nutrients, it also contains papain, an enzyme that aids in the digestion of protein. Harvest the fruit when the skin yields slightly to the touch and changes from green to completely gold. You&#39;ll notice a sweet, delicious aroma when it is fully ripe! Grow in full sun and well-drained soil.\n\n*****Hardiness Zone 8 and higher for outdoors*****\n\nFull sun, grows to 6&#39; in container, minimum temperature 50°F, blooms in spring.\n\nSEEDS are from a 100% Self-pollinating, hermaphrodite plant!\nGrow it inside in the winter and take it outside in the summer months!\n– Pack of 20 seeds –",

Our website is www.RedCedarWoodcraft.com....\r\n\r\nWe strive to blend art and function.  We wish for our Wood planters, vases and frames to be stand alone art items that can sit on a table and look cool.  If you decide to add some flowers or photos, then it gets even better.\r\n\r\nWe specialize in custom sized planter...you really cannot find many people who build custom work these days !    Many of our wood planters are “compartmental&quot; and &quot;sectional” :  ones that have divided planting spaces.  \r\n\r\nSome of our larger planters are “separate & sectional”:  they have multiple separate individual planter parts that can be stacked together to form a larger planter piece.  We designed these for townhouse and condo dwellers that have limited space on their outdoor balconies.  \r\n\r\nOur wooden art and photo frames are of unique design.  We believe that the art frame should be a work of art itself... you remove the photo, and the frame can stand alone as a piece of wood art.   \r\n\r\nWe&#39;ve recently gotten into &quot;art pieces&quot;... the sculptures and wall hangings are a recent development.   The Name Shelves have been a nice addition also... popular for childrens&#39; rooms.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;ll keep designing.  You keep buying.\r\n\r\nEnjoy. \r\n\r\n",

Our website is www.RedCedarWoodcraft.com....\r\n\r\nWe strive to blend art and function.  We wish for our Wood planters, vases and frames to be stand alone art items that can sit on a table and look cool.  If you decide to add some flowers or photos, then it gets even better.\r\n\r\nWe specialize in custom sized planter...you really cannot find many people who build custom work these days !    Many of our wood planters are “compartmental&quot; and &quot;sectional” :  ones that have divided planting spaces.  \r\n\r\nSome of our larger planters are “separate & sectional”:  they have multiple separate individual planter parts that can be stacked together to form a larger planter piece.  We designed these for townhouse and condo dwellers that have limited space on their outdoor balconies.  \r\n\r\nOur wooden art and photo frames are of unique design.  We believe that the art frame should be a work of art itself... you remove the photo, and the frame can stand alone as a piece of wood art.   \r\n\r\nWe&#39;ve recently gotten into &quot;art pieces&quot;... the sculptures and wall hangings are a recent development.   The Name Shelves have been a nice addition also... popular for childrens&#39; rooms.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;ll keep designing.  You keep buying.\r\n\r\nEnjoy. \r\n\r\n",

"announcement": "Red Cedar Woodcraft is a craft woodshop dedicated to unique style wood planters, wood frames, and wood art.     Our website is www.RedCedarWoodcraft.com....\r\n\r\nWe strive to blend art and function.  We wish for our Wood planters, vases and frames to be stand alone art items that can sit on a table and look cool.  If you decide to add some flowers or photos, then it gets even better.\r\n\r\nWe specialize in custom sized planter...you really cannot find many people who build custom work these days !    Many of our wood planters are “compartmental&quot; and &quot;sectional” :  ones that have divided planting spaces.  \r\n\r\nSome of our larger planters are “separate & sectional”:  they have multiple separate individual planter parts that can be stacked together to form a larger planter piece.  We designed these for townhouse and condo dwellers that have limited space on their outdoor balconies.  \r\n\r\nOur wooden art and photo frames are of unique design.  We believe that the art frame should be a work of art itself... you remove the photo, and the frame can stand alone as a piece of wood art.   \r\n\r\nWe&#39;ve recently gotten into &quot;art pieces&quot;... the sculptures and wall hangings are a recent development.   The Name Shelves have been a nice addition also... popular for childrens&#39; rooms.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;ll keep designing.  You keep buying.\r\n\r\nEnjoy. \r\n\r\n",

"title": "Round Terrarium - Woodland Themed ~ Yellow Snail & Mushroom",
"description": "This adorable hanging terrarium is sure to make you smile not only because it&#39;s so sweet but because there is NO watering required and it&#39;s pretty much maintenance free!\n\nI love terrariums  but my customers would tell me that as much as they loved them they didn&#39;t like watering, keeping them clean and maintaining the plants.   So I decided to start making DRY Terrariums.  All the color and green of regular terrariums but instead I use preserved mosses and silk flowers.  I add my polymer clay miniatures to make them a bit magical and the result is a truly unique little glass world.  They are my number one seller at shows because they are delicate and adorable at the same time!\n\nDETAILS-\n\nThis Terrarium features an adorable little yellow snail with a white and blue shell.  He is sitting next to a yellow and mint green mushroom with green and natural moss and white floral touches surrounding him.  The scene is mounted on a birch wood cutting from New Hampshire.\n\nEach terrarium is handmade by me, using only my designs and imagination.\n\nAll the clay figures are handmade by me.\n\nI create the tiny worlds outside of the terrarium and like a &quot;ship-in-a-bottle&quot; I carefully place them inside.  \n\nEach scene is a ONE OF A KIND because each sculpture and scene develops organically. \n\nTerrarium is a 4&quot; round glass bubble terrarium and only weighs 7oz  (another plus to dry terrariums) \n\nIt will easily hang from a window, ceiling or whatnot quite easily by threading some twine or ribbon through the top hole. \n\nThis scene is glued in place so it will stay in the position seen in the photo.\n\nCARE:\n\nWhen you receive your terrarium, remove the protective packaging inside and simply blow into the terrarium.  This should clear any moss or debris that has settled due to shipping.\n\nDO NOT TRY TO TAKE SCENE OUT, \n\nTake glass cleaner and wipe the outside and inside if desired.  You find fingerprints on them regularly as people love to pick them up and look inside.\n\nNO WATERING\n\nNO Pruning\n\nEnjoy looking at your little scene!\n\nNotes:\n\nThese terrariums delight kids, however they are not designed as toys or intended for children.  The glass will break if dropped. \n\nIf you are a local customer you may contact me BEFORE you check out and I will remove shipping charge.\n\nI mail first class mail, if you would like to have it shipped priority the charge is $7.15 for shipping and I will need to change that before you purchase.  Just send me a conversation and I&#39;ll be happy to update for you.",

So I decided to start making DRY Terrariums.  All the color and green of regular terrariums but instead I use preserved mosses and silk flowers.  I add my polymer clay miniatures to make them a bit magical and the result is a truly unique little glass world.  They are my number one seller at shows because they are delicate and adorable at the same time!\n\nDETAILS-\n\nThis Terrarium features one of my signature gnomes inside a MEDIUM sized teardrop terrarium with light green foliage, a red ladybug, a red mushroom, preserved moss and white flowers.   The scene is mounted on a birch wood cutting from New Hampshire.  \n\nThe terrarium is teardrop shaped and stands appox. 7&quot; tall and 3.5&quot; wide.  \n\nEach terrarium is handmade by me, using only my designs and imagination.\n\nAll the clay figures are handmade by me.\n\nI create the tiny worlds outside of the terrarium and like a &quot;ship-in-a-bottle&quot; I carefully place them inside.  \n\nI DO NOT glue the little scenes down inside the terrarium because I&#39;ve found that people like to shift them to see different parts outside of the opening.  They will not fall out, they are larger than the hole and quite happy where they are. \n\nEach scene is a ONE OF A KIND because each sculpture and scene develops organically. \n\nIt will easily hang from a window, ceiling or whatnot quite easily by threading some twine or ribbon through the top hole. \n\nCARE:\n\nWhen you receive your terrarium, remove the protective packaging inside and simply blow into the terrarium.  This should clear any moss or debris that has settled due to shipping.\n\nPut your thumb and finger inside and shift the scene in the direction you most like.  DO NOT TRY TO TAKE SCENE OUT, this will likely result in your scene breaking as you force it out of the hole.\n\nTake glass cleaner and wipe the outside and inside if desired.  You find fingerprints on them regularly as people love to pick them up and look inside.\n\nNO WATERING\n\nNO Pruning\n\nEnjoy looking at your little scene!\n\nNotes:\n\nYou will receive the  EXACT terrarium pictured.\n\nThese terrariums delight kids, however they are not designed as toys or intended for children.  The glass will break if dropped. \n\nIf you are a local customer you may contact me BEFORE you check out and I will remove shipping charge.\n\nI mail first class mail, if you would like to have it shipped priority the charge is $7.15 for shipping and I will need to change that before you purchase.  Just send me a conversation and I&#39;ll be happy to update for you.",

So I decided to start making DRY Terrariums.  All the color and green of regular terrariums but instead I use preserved mosses and silk flowers.  I add my polymer clay miniatures to make them a bit magical and the result is a truly unique little glass world.  They are my number one seller at shows because they are delicate and adorable at the same time!\n\nDETAILS-\n\nThis Terrarium features an adorable little frog  sitting next to a red toadstool.   There are tiny white flowers, green and natural moss, light green foliage and real bark with dried lichen.  The scene is mounted on a birch wood cutting from New Hampshire.  \n\nThe terrarium is teardrop shaped and stands appox. 5&quot; tall and 3&quot; wide.  \n\nEach terrarium is handmade by me, using only my designs and imagination.\n\nAll the clay figures are handmade by me.\n\nI create the tiny worlds outside of the terrarium and like a &quot;ship-in-a-bottle&quot; I carefully place them inside.  \n\nI DO NOT glue the little scenes down inside the terrarium because I&#39;ve found that people like to shift them to see different parts outside of the opening.  They will not fall out, they are larger than the hole and quite happy where they are. \n\nEach scene is a ONE OF A KIND because each sculpture and scene develops organically. \n\nIt will easily hang from a window, ceiling or whatnot quite easily by threading some twine or ribbon through the top hole. \n\nCARE:\n\nWhen you receive your terrarium, remove the protective packaging inside and simply blow into the terrarium.  This should clear any moss or debris that has settled due to shipping.\n\nPut your thumb and finger inside and shift the scene in the direction you most like.  DO NOT TRY TO TAKE SCENE OUT, this will likely result in your scene breaking as you force it out of the hole.\n\nTake glass cleaner and wipe the outside and inside if desired.  You find fingerprints on them regularly as people love to pick them up and look inside.\n\nNO WATERING\n\nNO Pruning\n\nEnjoy looking at your little scene!\n\nNotes:\n\nYou will receive the  EXACT terrarium pictured.\n\nThese terrariums delight kids, however they are not designed as toys or intended for children.

"title": "Round Terrarium - Woodland Themed ~ Lady Bug ~ Mushrooms",
"description": "This adorable hanging terrarium is sure to make you smile not only because it&#39;s so sweet but because there is NO watering required and it&#39;s pretty much maintenance free!\n\nI love terrariums  but my customers would tell me that as much as they loved them they didn&#39;t like watering, keeping them clean and maintaining the plants.   So I decided to start making DRY Terrariums.  All the color and green of regular terrariums but instead I use preserved mosses and silk flowers.  I add my polymer clay miniatures to make them a bit magical and the result is a truly unique little glass world.  They are my number one seller at shows because they are delicate and adorable at the same time!\n\nDETAILS-\n\nThis Terrarium features an adorable little ladybug nestled in hill of moss and red mushrooms.   There are tiny white and yellow  flowers, green and natural moss, a green fern and real bark with dried lichen.  The scene is mounted on a birch wood cutting from New Hampshire.\n\nEach terrarium is handmade by me, using only my designs and imagination.\n\nAll the clay figures are handmade by me.\n\nI create the tiny worlds outside of the terrarium and like a &quot;ship-in-a-bottle&quot; I carefully place them inside.  \n\nI DO NOT glue the little scenes down inside the terrarium because I&#39;ve found that people like to shift them to see different parts outside of the opening.  They will not fall out, they are larger than the hole and quite happy where they are. \n\nEach scene is a ONE OF A KIND because each sculpture and scene develops organically. \n\nTerrarium is a 4&quot; round glass bubble terrarium and only weighs 7oz  (another plus to dry terrariums) \n\nIt will easily hang from a window, ceiling or whatnot quite easily by threading some twine or ribbon through the top hole. \n\nCARE:\n\nWhen you receive your terrarium, remove the protective packaging inside and simply blow into the terrarium.  This should clear any moss or debris that has settled due to shipping.\n\nPut your thumb and finger inside and shift the scene in the direction you most like.  DO NOT TRY TO TAKE SCENE OUT, this will likely result in your scene breaking as you force it out of the hole.\n\nTake glass cleaner and wipe the outside and inside if desired.  You find fingerprints on them regularly as people love to pick them up and look inside.\n\nNO WATERING\n\nNO Pruning\n\nEnjoy looking at your little scene!\n\nNotes:\n\nYou will receive the Terrarium with yellow accents and green lichen bark.  The other one pictured has sold. \n\nThese terrariums delight kids, however they are not designed as toys or intended for children.  The glass will break if dropped. \n\nIf you are a local customer you may contact me BEFORE you check out and I will remove shipping charge.\n\nI mail first class mail, if you would like to have it shipped priority the charge is $7.15 for shipping and I will need to change that before you purchase.  Just send me a conversation and I&#39;ll be happy to update for you.",

"description": "PACKAGE INCLUDES: \n\n5 Sago Palm (Cycas) Seeds \n\n\n○ GROWING METHOD \n\nStep 1 \n\nFill a gallon-sized pot with soilless potting mix to within an inch of the pot&#39;s brim. \n\nStep 2 \n\nClean the seed if it was not harvested immediately prior to you planting it. Using a knife, cut into the fibrous husk that covers the seed and peel it off to reveal the smooth seed inside. \n\nStep 3 \n\nBury the seed in the soilless potting mix to a depth so that its top surface is just barely visible. \n\nStep 4 \n\nWater the pot twice a day or as necessary to keep the top couple of inches of potting mix moist. \n\nStep 5 \n\nPlace the pot in a brightly lit area that is out of direct sunlight. For the best germination rates, maintain a temperature around the pot of 25-27°C (80-85°F). The areca palm will typically germinate within two to six weeks. \n\nNB: If not planting your seeds straight away. It is recommended that they are cleaned by peeling off their outer husk, then putting them in a breathable bag at a temperature of 20-22°C (73°F) for up to 12 months.",

"title": "Dwarf Lychee (Litchi chinensis) Tree SEEDS: The Best Kept Ancient Chinese Secret",
"description": "Dwarf Lychee (Litchi chinensis) Tree SEEDS: The Best Kept Ancient Chinese Secret\n\nThis Self Pollinating Lychee has a lush, dark green foliage that adds great contrast to the Lychee (or litchi) fruits that hang in bunches like giant, rose colored grapes.  The tree is admired both for its tempting fruit as well as the tree’s distinctive visual appeal.  If your imagination came up with its own fruit with the perfect flavor, it would be the Lychee.  It’s no wonder many Asian restaurants serve them sometimes accompanied by ice cream after a satisfying meal.  A rugged outer skin flakes away easily revealing the delicate, velvety fruit that waits beneath the skin.  Bite into the moist, sweet flesh and experience the rush of exotic flavor unique to the Lychee fruit.  \n\nSo different in taste, the Lychee’s white, somewhat translucent flesh almost defies description.  Some say the taste is like combining the flavors of pear, grape and coconut milk all in one fruit.  Lychees are easy to prepare and taste delicious when eaten chilled.  \n \nLychees are very good for you. Seven lychees have as much vitamin C as a small orange which is 100 per cent of the recommended daily intake of vitamin C!\n\n- Pack of 5 seeds –",

"description": "Sweet “Sylvia” Upright Cherry (Prunus avium) Tree - Self-fertile Dwarf Tree SEEDS.\n\nThe “Sylvia” is an early blooming that brings delicate spring cherry blossom followed by a mass of delicious fruit in July! This mid-season cherry is a naturally compact variety with an upright growth. It produces a dark red heart-shaped fruit that is of high quality for fresh eating and equally well-suited for canning, drying, or freezing. Although, by mid-summer, you’ll be picking more cherries than you can eat!\nAlso, unlike most sweet cherries, Sylvia is self-fertile and is also an excellent pollinator for other varieties.\n*****Hardiness Zone 5 to 8*****\n\n– Pack of 6 seeds – “Germination instructions included in package”",

"title": "RARE Dwarf Longan “Sri Chompoo” aka Dragon Eye Exotic Fruit SEEDS in container",
"description": "RARE Dwarf Longan “Sri Chompoo” aka Dragon Eye Translucent Flesh Fruit SEEDS\n\n &quot;Dragon Eye&quot; is so named because it resembles an eyeball when its fruit is shelled (the black seed shows through the translucent flesh like a pupil/iris).\n\nLongan Sri Chompoo “Dimocarpus longan”, a very rare and highly sought after compact growing selection of longan sourced from Thailand. This makes the longan suitable for some backyard gardens limited in space. Grows to 3&#39; to 5&#39; in a container! Containers help save space in your garden by utilizing your patio or even balcony space!\n \nSome people don&#39;t like the lychee fruit, complaining that it is too sweet, but the longan fruit has just enough tartness and muskiness to make it more palatable. However, it is still sweet with a pleasant aroma. Longan has a translucent flesh that has grape-like texture. It is related to the lychee, and also similar in that it grows on trees in bunches.\n \nThe tree forms a dense, round or oblong canopy of evergreen foliage. The bark is rough and corky. Glossy, dark green leaflets grow in pairs on opposite sides of leaf stems. Each stem hold six to nine pairs of 6 to 8 inch leaflets. The oblong or lancet-shaped foliage is tough and leathery with wavy margins. Flowering occurs around March, and fruits ripen from July to September.\n \n*****Hardiness Zone 10 to 11*****\n– Pack of 5 seeds – “Germination instructions and growing Guide included in package”",

"description": "Extremely Dwarf Musa “Truly Tiny” Edible Banana (Musa acuminata) Tree Seeds – Indoor Outdoor Plant    \n\nThis extremely Dwarf Musa “Truly Tiny” species grows vigorously and produce small fruit similar to Dwarf Cavendish. Forget about huge banana plants that need a lot of room. This unique Extreme Dwarf allows for growing inside the home, on the porch, or on a patio. It has a very symmetrical and compact appearance.\n\nHowever, the plant &quot;Truly Tiny&quot; do not exhibit characteristics completely consistent with the Dwarf Cavendish. The maximum height for this variety is between 24 and 30 inches, which makes “Truly Tiny” the shortest banana species.\n\nDue to its compactness, Musa “Truly Tiny” is ideally suited as a houseplant and as a tropical accent in the garden or container. This is very similar to the Dwarf Cavendish but much shorter. Its sweet bananas are also smaller than that of the Cavendish. “Truly Tiny” is an extremely dwarf banana tree, selected for its compact size and thick foliage. \n\n*****Hardiness Zone 7 to 10*****\n\n– Pack of 5 seeds – “Germination instructions included in package”\nThese seeds are guaranteed viable.

Our website is www.RedCedarWoodcraft.com....\r\n\r\nWe strive to blend art and function.  We wish for our Wood planters, vases and frames to be stand alone art items that can sit on a table and look cool.  If you decide to add some flowers or photos, then it gets even better.\r\n\r\nWe specialize in custom sized planter...you really cannot find many people who build custom work these days !    Many of our wood planters are “compartmental&quot; and &quot;sectional” :  ones that have divided planting spaces.  \r\n\r\nSome of our larger planters are “separate & sectional”:  they have multiple separate individual planter parts that can be stacked together to form a larger planter piece.  We designed these for townhouse and condo dwellers that have limited space on their outdoor balconies.  \r\n\r\nOur wooden art and photo frames are of unique design.  We believe that the art frame should be a work of art itself... you remove the photo, and the frame can stand alone as a piece of wood art.   \r\n\r\nWe&#39;ve recently gotten into &quot;art pieces&quot;... the sculptures and wall hangings are a recent development.   The Name Shelves have been a nice addition also... popular for childrens&#39; rooms.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;ll keep designing.  You keep buying.\r\n\r\nEnjoy. \r\n\r\n",

Our website is www.RedCedarWoodcraft.com....\r\n\r\nWe strive to blend art and function.  We wish for our Wood planters, vases and frames to be stand alone art items that can sit on a table and look cool.  If you decide to add some flowers or photos, then it gets even better.\r\n\r\nWe specialize in custom sized planter...you really cannot find many people who build custom work these days !    Many of our wood planters are “compartmental&quot; and &quot;sectional” :  ones that have divided planting spaces.  \r\n\r\nSome of our larger planters are “separate & sectional”:  they have multiple separate individual planter parts that can be stacked together to form a larger planter piece.  We designed these for townhouse and condo dwellers that have limited space on their outdoor balconies.  \r\n\r\nOur wooden art and photo frames are of unique design.  We believe that the art frame should be a work of art itself... you remove the photo, and the frame can stand alone as a piece of wood art.   \r\n\r\nWe&#39;ve recently gotten into &quot;art pieces&quot;... the sculptures and wall hangings are a recent development.   The Name Shelves have been a nice addition also... popular for childrens&#39; rooms.\r\n\r\nWe&#39;ll keep designing.  You keep buying.\r\n\r\nEnjoy. \r\n\r\n",

"description": "This adorable hanging terrarium is sure to make you smile not only because it&#39;s so sweet but because there is NO watering required and it&#39;s pretty much maintenance free!\n\nI love terrariums  but my customers would tell me that as much as they loved them they didn&#39;t like watering, keeping them clean and maintaining the plants.   So I decided to start making DRY Terrariums.  All the color and green of regular terrariums but instead I use preserved mosses and silk flowers.  I add my polymer clay miniatures to make them a bit magical and the result is a truly unique little glass world.  They are my number one seller at shows because they are delicate and adorable at the same time!\n\nDETAILS-\n\nThis Terrarium features an adorable little yellow snail with a white and blue shell.  He is sitting next to a yellow and mint green mushroom with green and natural moss and white floral touches surrounding him.  The scene is mounted on a birch wood cutting from New Hampshire.\n\nEach terrarium is handmade by me, using only my designs and imagination.\n\nAll the clay figures are handmade by me.\n\nI create the tiny worlds outside of the terrarium and like a &quot;ship-in-a-bottle&quot; I carefully place them inside.  \n\nEach scene is a ONE OF A KIND because each sculpture and scene develops organically. \n\nTerrarium is a 4&quot; round glass bubble terrarium and only weighs 7oz  (another plus to dry terrariums) \n\nIt will easily hang from a window, ceiling or whatnot quite easily by threading some twine or ribbon through the top hole. \n\nThis scene is glued in place so it will stay in the position seen in the photo.\n\nCARE:\n\nWhen you receive your terrarium, remove the protective packaging inside and simply blow into the terrarium.  This should clear any moss or debris that has settled due to shipping.\n\nDO NOT TRY TO TAKE SCENE OUT, \n\nTake glass cleaner and wipe the outside and inside if desired.  You find fingerprints on them regularly as people love to pick them up and look inside.\n\nNO WATERING\n\nNO Pruning\n\nEnjoy looking at your little scene!\n\nNotes:\n\nThese terrariums delight kids, however they are not designed as toys or intended for children.  The glass will break if dropped. \n\nIf you are a local customer you may contact me BEFORE you check out and I will remove shipping charge.\n\nI mail first class mail, if you would like to have it shipped priority the charge is $7.15 for shipping and I will need to change that before you purchase.  Just send me a conversation and I&#39;ll be happy to update for you.",

"description": "This adorable hanging terrarium is sure to make you smile not only because it&#39;s so sweet but because there is NO watering required and it&#39;s pretty much maintenance free!\n\nI love terrariums  but my customers would tell me that as much as they loved them they didn&#39;t like watering, keeping them clean and maintaining the plants.   So I decided to start making DRY Terrariums.  All the color and green of regular terrariums but instead I use preserved mosses and silk flowers.  I add my polymer clay miniatures to make them a bit magical and the result is a truly unique little glass world.  They are my number one seller at shows because they are delicate and adorable at the same time!\n\nDETAILS-\n\nThis Terrarium features an adorable little frog  sitting next to a red toadstool.   There are tiny white flowers, green and natural moss, light green foliage and real bark with dried lichen.  The scene is mounted on a birch wood cutting from New Hampshire.  \n\nThe terrarium is teardrop shaped and stands appox. 5&quot; tall and 3&quot; wide.  \n\nEach terrarium is handmade by me, using only my designs and imagination.\n\nAll the clay figures are handmade by me.\n\nI create the tiny worlds outside of the terrarium and like a &quot;ship-in-a-bottle&quot; I carefully place them inside.  \n\nI DO NOT glue the little scenes down inside the terrarium because I&#39;ve found that people like to shift them to see different parts outside of the opening.  They will not fall out, they are larger than the hole and quite happy where they are. \n\nEach scene is a ONE OF A KIND because each sculpture and scene develops organically. \n\nIt will easily hang from a window, ceiling or whatnot quite easily by threading some twine or ribbon through the top hole. \n\nCARE:\n\nWhen you receive your terrarium, remove the protective packaging inside and simply blow into the terrarium.  This should clear any moss or debris that has settled due to shipping.\n\nPut your thumb and finger inside and shift the scene in the direction you most like.  DO NOT TRY TO TAKE SCENE OUT, this will likely result in your scene breaking as you force it out of the hole.\n\nTake glass cleaner and wipe the outside and inside if desired.  You find fingerprints on them regularly as people love to pick them up and look inside.\n\nNO WATERING\n\nNO Pruning\n\nEnjoy looking at your little scene!\n\nNotes:\n\nYou will receive the  EXACT terrarium pictured.\n\nThese terrariums delight kids, however they are not designed as toys or intended for children.  The glass will break if dropped. \n\nIf you are a local customer you may contact me BEFORE you check out and I will remove shipping charge.\n\nI mail first class mail, if you would like to have it shipped priority the charge is $7.15 for shipping and I will need to change that before you purchase.  Just send me a conversation and I&#39;ll be happy to update for you.",

"description": "PACKAGE INCLUDES: \n\n5 Sago Palm (Cycas) Seeds \n\n\n○ GROWING METHOD \n\nStep 1 \n\nFill a gallon-sized pot with soilless potting mix to within an inch of the pot&#39;s brim. \n\nStep 2 \n\nClean the seed if it was not harvested immediately prior to you planting it. Using a knife, cut into the fibrous husk that covers the seed and peel it off to reveal the smooth seed inside. \n\nStep 3 \n\nBury the seed in the soilless potting mix to a depth so that its top surface is just barely visible. \n\nStep 4 \n\nWater the pot twice a day or as necessary to keep the top couple of inches of potting mix moist. \n\nStep 5 \n\nPlace the pot in a brightly lit area that is out of direct sunlight. For the best germination rates, maintain a temperature around the pot of 25-27°C (80-85°F). The areca palm will typically germinate within two to six weeks. \n\nNB: If not planting your seeds straight away. It is recommended that they are cleaned by peeling off their outer husk, then putting them in a breathable bag at a temperature of 20-22°C (73°F) for up to 12 months.",
